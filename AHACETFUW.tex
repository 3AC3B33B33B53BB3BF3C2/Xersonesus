\entry{A-50} {} {} {Russia's A-50, none of which were in production before, during, or after the Ukraine war, represented one of the relics of the Soviet ingenuity the collapse of the U.S.S.R. left behind. During the Ukraine war, Russia lost several A-50s. On February 23rd, 2023, the day after the first anniversary of the Ukraine war, Belarusian opposition groups allegedly attacked a Russian A-50 near Minsk at a Belarusian Air Force base called the Machulishchy Air Base. The head of the Belarusian opposition group, BYPOL (i.e., Aliaksandr Azarov), claimed to have executed the attack with drones (i.e., \texthebrew{רחפנים}). BYPOL is alleged to have been one of the defectors from the Belarusian state security services during the protests that erupted against Alexander Lukashenko in 2020.\footnote{[\texthebrew{חוגי אופוזיציה בבלו רוסיה: תקפנו  ברחפנים וגרמנו נזק למטוס פיקוד וביון רוסי ברייב A-50 שחנה בבסיס אווירי ליד מינסק, תיק דבקה
}]}} 

\entry{ADHD} {} {} {ADHD or Attention Deficit Hyperactive Disorder, is one of the many different pseudo neuroses broke, bankrupt, bribe-hungry psychologists, who are a proponent of Fromm's love on Monday, Freud's egotistical aspiration for sex on Tuesday, or Jung's shadow chasing on Wednesday, concocted to ensure American pharmaceutical companies, who are making hundreds of millions from even more enhanced synthetic forms of 20th century drugs such as Xanax\footnote{America's popular culture has missed no opportunity to promote Xanax. In a feature for Travis Scott's song, Sicko Mode, Drake glorifies the drug when he compares himself to a light in a cliché, saying "I did half a Xan, thirteen hours 'til I land Had me out like a light." }, could earn a tremendous amount from the creation of a new generation of drug addicts, who might be capable of superseding their parents' generation of Methamphetamine addicts, whose lives the modern American police state bureaucracy have exploited for an untold number of Court cases, imprisonments, or ruined lives from the 1970s to the present. }

\entry{ad hominem} {} {} {In the vast majority of cases where members of the community express opinions different from those of certain groups, representing hypotheses on the outcomes, solutions, or remedies for Ukraine's ultimate failure on the battlefield, the groups respond \textenglish{\emph{ad hominem}}.\footnote{You can read more about 𝑎𝑑 ℎ𝑜𝑚𝑖𝑛𝑒𝑚 arguments in Aristotle's 𝑆𝑜𝑝ℎ𝑖𝑠𝑡𝑖𝑐𝑎𝑙 𝑅𝑒𝑓𝑢𝑡𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛𝑠, 178(b)17 where Aristotle describes the 𝑟𝑖𝑠𝑢𝑠 𝑠𝑜𝑝ℎ𝑖𝑠𝑡𝑖𝑐𝑢𝑠 in which 'persons direct their solutions against the man, not against his arguments.'} The groups attack the person but leave his or her arguments in tact. The most common theme for an attack \emph{ad hominem} is to claim man is the measure of all things\footnote{Protagoras, the pre-Socratic Greek philosopher (c.490–c.420 BC) espoused the view. He stated: "\textgreek{πάντων χρημάτων μέτρον ἐστὶν ἄνθρωπος, τῶν μὲν ὄντων ὡς ἔστιν, τῶν δὲ οὐκ ὄντων ὡς οὐκ ἔστιν}."} so that by a measure of expertise (however unqualified it may actually be) a man from the group is higher, stronger or smarter than the attacked. In the vast majority of these cases, the measure for height, strength or intelligence is hardly based upon anything one might associate with these concepts, especially in terms of analysis. The vast majority of the assailants can hardly muster a record on predictions commensurate with intelligence. } 

\entry{Annenberg Foundation} {} {} {The Annenberg Foundation, one of the most important sources of free-market philanthropy in the history of the United States for education, contributed significantly to the development of objective consciousness among the American masses with the release of the first precursor to the development of Massive Open Online Courses during the 1980s. In its publications, some of which are among the absolute best in terms of pedagogy, content or intellectual challenge, Annenberg inspired Americans to study Spanish, French, Physics, or the history of the West, broadcasting America's finest professors from the best universities in the world right into American living rooms on Public Broadcasting Companies' channels. In its release of \emph{Destinos}, the Annenberg Foundation, provided Americans with the opportunity to study Spanish for free in 58 lessons; detailing the revelation a survivor of the Spanish Civil War, the war the Soviets and the Russians utilized to experiment with doctrine and weapons, discloses to his family about a forsaken bride, \emph{Destinos} takes viewers from basic to intermediate Spanish. The legendary \emph{French in Action} features the Capretz Method for learning language the creator of the course, Pierre Capretz, developed in his accompanying textbooks for the course. A 52 episode television series that combines language instruction with cultural immersion into a French family in Paris, France, Capretz produced the series at both Yale University and Wellesley College, the latter still being a leader in the pedagogy of foreign languages with its three part Italian course on \emph{edX}\footnote{}. Still widely used since 1987, \emph{French in Action} is a classic for foreign language learning in America during the 1980s. Funded entirely by the Annenberg Foundation, \emph{French in Action} provided Americans, tired, overwhelmed with debt, laboring under glass cielings in industries whose unions long ago sold their souls to the Federal Bureau of Investigation for large salaries, a way not only to view an almost unreachable world abroad but adopt the speaking lifestyle of its characters from the comfort of home. In its lecture series from the University of California, Los Angeles, the Annenberg Foundation provided Americans with a glimpse into the delicacies of the Western Tradition over more than 3000 years of history. \newline \indent The most famous of all projects the Annenberg Foundation released is a series of lectures by a professor named Goldstein at California Polytechnic State University, San Luis Obispo entitled \emph{The Mechanical Universe}. In much the same way as Capretz own textbook for \emph{French in Action} is a classic for language learners, Goldstein's own textbook, \emph{The Mechanical Universe and Beyond}, is itself a classic. In the history of pedagogy for physics there is perhaps no better textbook than Goldstein's own. \newline \indent Goldstein's lectures, which provided Americans with access to the history of science in terms of its development over time from the Ancient Greek discoveries in geometry through the Renaissance developments in the destruction of the Aristotelian universe to the emergence of the major contributors to theoretical physics such as James Clark Maxwell or Albert Einstein, are one of the most valuable for developing objective consciousness among the American masses. The Catholic Church, depicted in the video with revealing light, takes Galileo, the founder of law of inertia, to Court for his views on the relation of the sun to the earth in the revolutions of the heavenly spheres. Descartes, whose metaphysics, the \emph{Meditations}, launched a major revision of the theoretical basis for being, unveils his geometric interpretation of algebra. Leibniz and Newton and their famous dispute over priority for the calculus play out across multiple episodes. Benjamin Franklin, whose mathematics the author appraises without a single doubt, receives credit for his discover of positively or negatively charged electricity.  While the series hardly touches upon the subjects many of the figures from the Enlightenment raised in famous treatises, the series establishes a mechanistic point of view about the universe in a way no competing, contemporary, or pre-existing popular television series could have at the time. No MOOC has ever come to rival Goldstein's \emph{The Mechanical Universe}. It is an all around classic. \newline \indent Sadly, the Annenberg Foundation's series are no longer televised on American television channels primarily due to the fact that there are no longer channels. Its era of television is no longer existent. While the series themselves advertise purchase video cassette, the most frequently visited sites on the Internet for torrents provide downloads with a large number of seeders.

\entry{Artemovsk} {Donbas} {village} {See \textbf{Bakhmut-Artemovsk}.}

\entry{Artillery} {weapon} { } {In a phrase coined by the gravedigger of the revolution,\footnote{In his profound study of the social origins of the Soviet Union after Stalin's rise to power, \emph{The Revolution Betrayed}, Trotsky explained how without a worker revolution based on the theory of permanent revolution but aiming to reintroduce Lenin's democratic centralism into the Communist Party, the degenerated Soviet worker's state would inevitably collapse from stagnation. Stalin's decision to impose Socialism in One Country on the Communist Party together with a series of bloody reprisals designed to effectuate a political genocide against the generation of Octoberist workers confirmed Trotsky's analysis when the Soviet Union, suffering from years of Stalin's policies, disintegrated on 26 December 1991 by Declaration No. 142-N, a declaration the Soviet of the Republics of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union made to dissolve the federation.} Joseph Stalin, artillery is the god of war. The god of war, however, is now but only a vital component in an evolving array of combined arms in eastern Europe. In the beginning of the Ukraine war the  media focused almost exclusively on parity. The number of Russian artillery guns, calibre, the number of munitions, the type of munitions, or the way in which the Russians accurately targeted Ukrainian targets demonstrated the advantage Russia weaned over its opponent. ّIn nearly every category, the Russians managed to demonstrate a noticeable superiority, a superiority not merely in quantity but in quality. The range of Russian calibres for artillery, for instance, far exceeded that of the Ukrainians. Confined to the 155mm M777 howitzers, the Ukrainians could not exercise fire control over battle areas in the way the Russians did. \newline \indent In the beginning of the Ukraine war, primarily before the great Ukrainian offensive in Kharkiv, launched on September 6th but largely until the end of Ukraine's 'Spring' counteroffensive in 2023, artillery played a dominant role on the battlefield. Ukraine's failed 'Spring' counteroffensive confirmed Russia's seizure of the strategic initiative after the fall of Bakhmut-Artemovsk on May 23rd, 2023. In the winter of 2023 the Ukraine war underwent a major transformation in the deployment of drones. Ukraine began to mass produce First Person View (FPV) drones to strengthen its defense of the Donbas in the face of continued Russian advances. Necessity is the mother of invention but the transformation could have come soon enough for Ukraine's defense of Avdiivka, a major turning point in the Ukraine war after the fall of Bakhmut-Artemovsk for Russian tactics (i.e., tunneling and FAB bombing with ”glide kits”) and Ukraine's deficiencies in artillery. Ukraine's FPV drones began to play a dominant role on the battlefield, overtaking but by no means substituting for the role artillery played in the beginning of the war. The first Ukrainian brigades with dedicated, trained, expert drone pilots began to take shape.}

\entry{Aquinas, Thomas} {} {} {On March 7th, 2024, just after the second anniversary of the Ukraine war, Thomas Aquinas, a graduate from one of France's first universities, an intellectual giant who built a bridge from antiquity through the Dark Ages to the pre-Renaissance, celebrated his 750 anniversary.}

% Aquinas is a most seditious philosopher for the United States; his belief in the promulgation of the law is contrary to the U.S.'s decision to subvert the logic of its decisions from what is principally sound into asinine contortions pulled from thin air; his belief in a correspondence theory of truth derived from Aristotle's understanding of speech is exceptionally subversive in an environment where lies, deceit, or falsehood are constantly peddled as a matter of course to the masses in propaganda reel after reel. The Western media therefore covered only very little about Aquinas, seeking to ensure that his revolutionary doctrines on law or truth remain submerged in the hundreds of unbound pages his unread books conceal to the unconscious. 

\entry{Avdiivka} {Donbas} {village} {Ukraine's defense of Avdiivka, a major turning point in the Ukraine war after the fall of Bakhmut-Artemovsk for Russian tactics (i.e., tunneling and FAB bombing with ”glide kits”) and Ukraine's deficiencies in artillery and its deployment of FPV drones, collapsed on January 17th, 2024.}

\entry{Axe, David} {} {} {One of the more committed journalists of the Ukraine war, whose coverage of the Donbas, especially in the Avdiivka direction\footnote{One of the most important contributions to understanding the Ukraine's defeat in the Avdiivka direction is the 47th Mechanized Brigade in 2024. A prominent unit in the Ukrainian military, heavily involved in fighting Russian forces in the Avdiivka direction, particularly with Western-supplied equipment like M-1 Abrams tanks and M-2 Bradley fighting vehicles, the 47th Brigade perished within less than six months from its reconstitution. Deployed to Pavlohrad, 60 miles west of Pokrovsk, the front line in eastern Ukraine’s Donetsk Oblast, fought desperately with the 31 M-1 Abrams tanks to stop Russian advances. Consequently, the 47th Brigade lost more than half of its company of 31 M-1 Abrams tanks to Russian attacks. While the attacks claiming these tanks vary, the vast majority of the attacks stem from Russian FPV drones. The perished 47th Mechanized Brigade demonstrated that Western military equipment, though not obsolete by any means, was, nonetheless, no match for Russia on the battlefield in the Avdiivka direction. The destruction of the first M-1 Abrams tank, long considered to be the world's best tank, shattered the illusion of the overwhelming invincibility of American firepower. Not only were the tanks underwhelming, they were distinctively vulnerable.} from 2023 to the present, eclipsed others. Published primarily in \emph{Forbes}, these articles are an important source of information. At a time when the majority of news from the frontlines comes almost exclusively from 'milbloggers,' Axe's analyses shed light on rarely mentioned or hardly examined aspects of the Ukraine war. These aspects, though without the extensive detail of a comprehensive study, allow readers to imagine the whole of the subconscious iceberg from a partial view of its conscious tip. \newline \indent \emph{Forbes}, however, is a publication with a purpose. Its annual lists of America's four hundred richest Americans shows how its purpose, however, may converge with another. These lists, for instance, constituted one of the Socialist Equality Party's primary staples of propaganda in the years preceding the 2008 subprime mortgage crisis, the decade after the party's launch of the World Socialist Website in 1998\footnote{The SEP's launch preceded the Federal Bureau of Investigation's launch of a Federal Intrusion Detection Network, or FIDNET, modeled after a famous program from Linux's suite of open source security software called Snort, a network intrusion detection system (NIDS). Mentioned in the article published on  August 10th, 1999, under the title "White House plan for FBI Internet spying," FIDNET is one of the earliest precursors to the drag-net surveillance Edward Snowden exposed in his leak of secret documents from the National Security Agency (NSA). Originally exposed in an article published on July 28th, 1999, by the \emph{New York Times} under the title, "The U.S. Drawing Plan That Will Monitor Computer Systems," FIDNET is a part of the pre-history to the U.S. conspiracy to deprive citizens of life, liberty, or the pursuit of happiness through the technological obliteration of the founding father's Bill of Rights, especially the Fourth Amendment. Although the early SEP article makes no mention of the U.S. Constitution, the legal critique, so famous now, would only become more provocative as the U.S. conspiracy strengthened its execution.} under the pretense of a Marxian renaissance.\footnote{In an article published on October 31st, 1998 under the title, "International school examines the century’s central problems of history, politics and culture," the International Committee of the Fourth International emphasized how a "central premise guiding the school was that a renaissance of Marxism is fundamental to the development of a perspective that can answer the burning issues of the day—growing social inequality, deepening economic crises, the decline in the cultural level of society and the prevailing political paralysis of the workers movement."} The SEP's early articles\footnote{The first appears to be ["Gap between rich and poor is wider than ever," June 23, 1998] but many more follow: ["The Forbes 200 list: billions for the privileged few," June 30, 1999], ["Forbes 400 list of richest Americans: snapshot of a financial oligarchy," September 24th, 2004], ["Forbes reports bonanza for world’s billionaires," May 9th, 2005], ["The very rich in America: “The kind of money you cannot comprehend," April 19, 2006], ["Forbes publishes list of 400 richest Americans," October 6, 2006], ["The filthy rich: Forbes lists America’s top 400 for 2007," November 27th, 2007], ["America’s “Fortunate 400” control vast wealth," March 7th, 2008].} demonstrate this convergence. Opposed to the decade of doldrums, history's acceleration, however, has required expanded coverage of more fundamental political issues such as the Ukraine war. \newline \indent Axe's ability to achieve T.S. Eliot's ideal for the portrayal of an event, however tainted by his ambition for a Ukrainian victory, in his reporting on the war could not but be a source of concern for a magazine dedicated to celebrating the richest 400 Americans annually. The inversion of the invisible but highly detailed iceberg from the visible but only slightly detailed tip in his writing provided readers with far more with which to imagine the truth than receive a programmed vision of propaganda. It is simply unacceptable. It is pure blasphemy! It would thus only be a matter of time before \emph{Forbes}, whose aim is to articulate the interests of this wealthy elite, would clash with Axe's reporting on the Ukraine war, a war politicized to the extreme. At the end of the day, \emph{Forbes}, famous for its annual celebrations of the country's top one percent, decided to fire Axe, terminating his coverage before the end of the Ukraine war, the outcome of which has been to deprive not only the present but posterity of one its auspicious eyes.

\entry{Bakhmut-Artemovsk} {} {} {The city whose fall sounded a death knell for the Ukrainian strategic initiative. Spelt \textukrainian{Бахмут — Артемівськ} in Ukrainian but —  \textrussian{Бахмут — Артемовск} in Russian, the city's history is unique. \newline \indent During the Nazi retreat in the aftermath of Operation Barbarossa's failure in 1943, Manstein, the 1st conquerer of Sevastopol, an expert in warfare against the Soviets, the Field Marshall whose counterstroke against the Soviets at Orel created the Kursk salient, organized Bakhmut-Artemovsk together Slavyansk and Kramatorsk into the Nazi lynchpin of defense for the Donbas. It is alleged that the Nazis withdrew before the Soviets managed to lay siege to the city, indicating that the Nazis never lost but forfeit the city. The fall of Bakhmut-Artemovsk therefore contained immense political, historical, military significance for the Russians. Ukraine's inability to stand the village up against the Russians terminated its ability to cling to the mythological power of its stand against the Soviets during the 1943 Nazi retreat, severing the early Ukrainian Galician narrative from Ukraine's armed forces. The Russians sacked the stronghold at Bakhmut-Artemovsk, preventing the Ukrainians from being able to revive the myth of Manstein's defense. The Ukrainian affinity for Nazism, renaming its streets after members of the Galician SS,\footname{Nazi generals considered the Galician SS to be an militarily inferior unit in the Nazi \emph{Wehrmacht}, denigrating its ability to conduct maneuvers, defend, or fight on the Eastern front.} stopped, dying silently without much of a trace in the media.

}

\entry{Barabbas} {} {} {A magnificent man, a man of many talents, fond of alcohol, games, the harem, Barabbas is alleged to have been a Jewish bandit who encouraged large crowds to raise up against the Roman occupiers of Jerusalem, the center of the earth. Pardoned at the Passover feast by the  eloquent, gracious, magnanimous Roman governor, Pontius Pilate, an executioner who deferred judgement on Jesus' death to the crowd that chose Barabbas,\footnote{John 18:39-40} Barabbas narrowly escaped death. Is Barabbas, a rhetorician, so awe-inspiring as to have compelled a crowd to select him over an ostracized, though marginally influential, prophet from  Nazareth or were the crowds so cognizant of Pilate's dilemma as to have preferred a direct challenger to Rome's reign over the city than the hypothetical promise of its theological subversion through a universalization of Judaism from a man who rode into the city of Jerusalem on a donkey? Setting aside these two men, whose natures are equally obscure and inexplicable, what of the crowd? What is the significance of the crowd's choice? Did the crowd make a cognizant choice? If the crowd made a cognizant choice, why has so much history been dedicated to Jesus of Nazareth, whereas men like Barabbas, who embodied the spirit of defiance, the force of resistance, the soul of revolution, have been marginalized to the back pages of obscure variations in Biblical texts? Should not the world over celebrate the day Pilate pardoned Barabbas\footnote{Isn't Pilate's pardon an atonement? No longer subject to the death penalty, Barabbas became subject to himself. Is that not an atonement? "For the life of the flesh is in the blood." Leviticus 17:11 Certainly, Barabbas' blood continued to circulate throughout his flesh after Pilate's pardon.} as a great holiday for mankind? Is not the history of mankind the history of crowd struggle? The crowd struggled. The crowd chose. The crowd chose Barabbas but Barabbas pales now in comparison to the fame, legend, or mythology of Jesus. As opposed to Jesus, the day of the Passover feast in the year of Jesus' death is not the beginning of a new era! What treachery! The date in the Western tradition for the beginning of the new era should not be "A.D." but "A.P." It should start with the Passover feast when Pilate, whose address to the crowd emphasized his eloquence, whose deference to the crowd's judgement magnified his grace, whose pardon symbolized his magnanimity for all of mankind, decided to acquiesce to the crowd. Does Pilate's acquiescence not underscore how all of history is but the reaction to the actions a crowd takes? How could the entire history of mankind not been written for Barabbas, who gambled, who drank, who fornicated, the man whose humanity more resembles his fellow man than Jesus, who overturned tables of money at the temple (i.e., Matthew 21:12-13; Mark 11:15-18), who did not drink anything but water\footnote{It is alleged, however, that Jesus was a drunkard because he drank wine. It is unclear to what extent he drank wine but there are apparently no passages from the haystack of variations in the disorganized, lost, historically unverified Biblical texts indicating he slurred his words, blacked out, or engaged in drunken brawls, all activities commonplace to drunkards at the time of the great Roman republic.}, who did not ravage but loved the adulteress and the prostitute and supervised a whore's atonement.\footnote{How could Jesus have not liked prostitutes after the way the one from Luke 7:38 treated him. She comes up behind him unannounced. She drops down into position on her knees. She sobs uncontrollably, soaking his feet. She cleaned his feet with her hair. She kissed his feet all over. Did she lick his toes or heel? She poured perfume on his feet after she spread her lips all over them. Who would not like a prostitute like the one from Luke 7:38? What man would not like the whore from Luke 7:38? \newline \indent In fact, Jesus appears to have equated the prospect for a prostitute's love to the height of her prices. Jesus' dialogue with Simon reads like a remarkably suggestive and provocative parable. After Jesus explains how a rich man cancelled debts for two men, one indebted to the tune of 50 silver pieces, the other 500, Simon asks him: Of the two forgiven men who do you suppose loved the borrower more? Simon says, "I suppose the one with the bigger debt." Jesus confirms his response. Luke 7:41-44 The confirmation, however, seems to suggest that the more a prostitute charges, the more she will love, since a person with the largest indebtedness is the one with the greatest love for the forgiving borrower. After all the difference in the constant between the debtors in the parable is nothing more than the amount of silver. The more silver, the more love. The less silver, the less love. The more debaucherous a prostitute solicits herself, the more forgiveness she may receive from Jesus. The more forgiveness she receives from Jesus, the most costly love she can offer back to him.} Why did humanity choose to follow the un-pardoned, executed rather than the pardoned, living man? How could history have been so unfair to Barabbas? What of the crowds of mankind that chose to follow Jesus rather than Barabbas after Jesus' death? What of the crowds of man that chose to follow Barabbas rather than Jesus after Barabbas lived? What liveliness inspired the crowds following Barabbas to emulate his image?\footnote{The pardon is the first step in the history of the revolution. In the age of Dostoyevsky, the so-called \emph{\textrussian{Петрашевцы}} in 1849 survived a firing squad only to carry the light of Karl Marx forward until eventually Lev Davidovich Bronstein, a contemporary Barabbas the Russian proletariat selected twice to lead a revolution against the Caesar of Russia, received a kind of pardon in 1905 with the exile he successfully evaded.}} 

% \newline \indent Although the origins of Barabbas may be obscure, Barabbas name is a source of immense obscurity. The number of variations abounds across the different languages, almost to a point where the only thing one can say for certain about his name is its similarity to Jesus.

\entry{Bryan, Julien} {} {} {In response to the revivification of Trump's so-called hemispheric defense during the Ukraine war, an attempt to recall the power America wielded over Latin America from 1898 to 1991, has brought to the surface of America's buried, 8-mm, 16-mm, or 32-mm history the films of Julien Bryan, who produced twenty three complete documentaries on South America,\footnote{Scholars tend to utilize multiple different types of categories to group Bryan's films. Chronologically, his films on South America are as follows: 1) 1941: \emph{Americans All}; 2) 1942: \emph{Argentine Primer}, \emph{Colombia: Crossroads of the Americas}, \emph{Venezuela Moves Ahead}, \emph{Roads South}, \emph{Schools to the South}, \emph{Children of the Americas}; 3) 1943: \emph{Atacama Desert}, \emph{Housing in Chile}, \emph{Good Neighbor Family}, \emph{Montevideo Family}, \emph{Young Uruguay}, \emph{Central Chile}, \emph{High Plain}, \emph{La Paz}; 4) 1944: \emph{Lima}, \emph{Lima Family}, \emph{Bolivia}; 5) 1945: \emph{Fundo in Chile}, \emph{Paraguay}, \emph{Peru}, \emph{South Chile}, \emph{Uruguay}. There are other groupings, however; these other groupings are not chronological but based on the film's subject matter.} four on Latin America as a region; five on Chile, three each about Peru, Bolivia, and Uruguay; and one each concerning Argentina, Columbia, Venezuela, and Paraguay. Although produced under the auspices of the Office of the Coordinator of Inter-American Affairs to foster hemispheric solidarity, Bryan's documentaries are a far cry from what might be reduced exclusively to the role of propaganda. Bryan's videos provide a unique glimpse of Latin America\footnote{Bryan's documentaries on the Middle East are equally valuable. In many of his documentaries on the Middle East, Bryan never fails to make mention of Christians, whose current role in the modern Middle East is far removed from the one contemporary Arab or Arabic news media envision.} in the post World War II era of unrivaled American superpower that ended sometime before the launch of Russia's full-scale invasion of the Ukraine. \newline \indent Although his analysis lacks the fire, resolve, or directionality of a communistic critique, Bryan's view of the regions of the world is a developing view of burgeoning classes of regional people. You can see these class descriptions in both his Latin American and his Middle Eastern documentaries. \newline \indent In his depictions of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, Bryan portrayed a view of Russian life few contemporary filmmakers ever achieved. Bryan characterizes the vast, fundamental, life-changing progress the Soviet Union achieved for Russians quickly with a list of hallmarks, the chief of which is leisure.\footnote{["Leisure Time : U.S.S.R.," \emph{International Film Foundation}. 1968]} Of leisure Bryan notes how the appetite for reading now is so keen for reading material that "often entire editions sell out overnight," whereas under the Czar "as much as 75 percent of Russians" could hardly read a letter, let alone write their own names.  In the Soviet Union there is a palace for pop culture; admission is free. The Russians, Bryan observes, call vacation on the Black Sea a "sanatorium." On vacation, Russians find "unfamiliar luxuries, better food, new accommodations, or sandy beaches." At the time, Russians were beginning "to discover that leisure is a time for realizing personal goals and private aspirations." In conclusion, Bryan characterizes the twenty century dilemma in the challenge of leisure time. The Soviet Union is but one example for his vision of the working man. Nearly a decade later, Bryan continued to provide Americans, if not the Anglophone world, with a glimpse behind the Iron Curtain. In a film produced in 1978, Bryan took a new look at the Soviet Union.\footnote{["The Soviet Union: A New Look," \emph{International Film Foundation}. 1978]} Passing from the February revolution with dual power to the Bolshevik seizure of power, Bryan calls the revolution's leaders "Marxist intellectuals," a favorable designation. Bryan traverses the years from Lenin's death to Stalin's ascension, briefly touching on the devastating impact of forced collectivization under Stalin's Five Year Plans. In his designation of the Soviet Union as the sole power in Europe after World War II, Bryan considers the Soviet Union's role critical to the Nazis' defeat. Bryan describes ordinary Soviet life.\footnote{Bryan makes about the notion of a free press is remarkably prescient. In the Soviet Union, Bryan narrates, "all form of communications are controlled by the State; every word in every newspaper and in every book must be approved before publication." Bryan's characterization of the Soviet Union's lack of a free press is precisely the type of control the United States of America has imposed upon its citizens; in the Federal Bureau of Investigation's attacks on the underground press, agents, quite like Stalinist, pursued the purveyors of the free press with an iron fist, grinding numerous American publications into the ground. The FBI's censorship of America's free press during the 1950s, 60s, 70s has resulted in the construction of a modern day state of censorship rivaled only by the late Soviet Union's own. In the book entitled, \emph{Unamerican Activities}, the authors describe how the anti-American Hooverites adopted the Stalinist policies, arresting, for instance, an editor for one of journals the anti-American Hooverite's disliked more than 52 times. Whereas the Stalinist had ceased to arrest artists by the time Bryan released his new look of the Soviet Union in 1978, the FBI was busy persecuting artistic editors by the hundreds, if not by the thousands, to ensure that all forms of communication came under the anti-American Hooverite's control.} Bryan concludes by saying, "Despite the high costs of Stalinism and the war, great progress has been made and Soviet society."}

\entry{Byrne, Oliver} {} {} {Oliver Byrne's chromatic interpretation of Euclid's elements is a pedagogical novelty.\footnote{In his \emph{Victorian book design} from 1963, McLean mentions Byrne's work. The well-known lecturer in the study of information design, Edward Tufte, also refers to Byrne's book in his work on graphic design, a huge cardboard briefcase with a plastic handle containing three indispensable volumes detailing how aura of information in the eye influences the observer. In 2010 Taschen republished the work in a facsimile edition.} Published in 1847 by Pickering, the book interprets the figures in Euclid's elements, whose original work contained no diagrams of any type, in terms of color. Prefiguring the modernist experiments of Bauhaus and De Stijl movements, Byrne's elements come to life. While the lively concept of a chromatic interpretation of geometric shapes lights a fire in the imagination full of different colors, the use of colored diagrams and symbols in the ever increasing rigor of Euclid's latter proofs reaches a limit no less elucidating than the letters; a chromatic interpretation of geometric shapes is suddenly no less accurate than an alphabetic one. The overwhelming contrast demonstrates how mathematicians, who are accustomed to view the language of the universe from the practice of their own point of view in the canon, take the assumed media of expression for granted when in all reality the a description of reality may be as diverse as reality itself. Just Desecrates interpreted algebra geometrically, Spinoza metaphysics, or Feynman the heavenly bodies (See Feynman), Byrne's interpretation of geometric with chromata represents a fundamental departure in the presentative historicity of mathematical expression. The fact that Byrne's rendition exceeded no more than Euclid's first six books emphasizes rather than negates the significance of his contribution for that field. Science does not meet art in Byrne's book; it is.}

An article published in the \emph{Washington Post} on December 5th, 2025 confirmed that ChatGPT has started the AI race. ["ChatGPT started the AI race.

A central lie in the Silicon Valley investors exploit to extract capital from technology on the stock market is kernalization. Similar to the way that Linux distributions are all based on a single kernel, the AI these competing companies are developing may not be truly distinct. Given the priority the Federal government has place on the development of AI there is every reason to suspect that unless or until a reverse engineer demonstrates that the binaries for these programs are truly distinct, these competing Silicon Valley companies, some of which are called, the Magnificent Seven, may be cooperating.} No computer scientist, for instance, utilizes the \emph{Minimalist Program} for parsing natural language sentences. In his own turn, Chomsky associated the responses ChatGPT produces with "glorified autocorrection," disputing the idea that AI generates grammatically sound sentences.\footnote{The fact that ChatGPT generates grammatically sound sentences literally obliterates Chomsky's theory of 'innateness' (i.e., Cartesian dualism) since there is no consciousness associated with ChatGPT.} Computer scientists have utilized a wide range of different linguistic theories for natural language processing (which used to be its own subject of study in academia but has since become subordinated to the study of AI). \newline \indent Chomsky's role in the area of politics sought to present intellectuals with the opportunity to represent the left without Karl Marx.

Although the name of the program is unknown, its purpose is not. Chomsky's book, \emph{Manufacturing Consent}, leaves no doubt about program's purpose. Whereas Chomsky criticizes the "effective and powerful ideological institutions that carry out a system-supportive propaganda function, by reliance on market forces, internalized assumptions, and self-censorship, and without overt coercion," the CIA program teaches its trainees how to empower institutions with ideology for the sake of carrying out a system-supportive propaganda function. By teaching trainees how to rely on market forces, compel journalist to internalize assumptions key to its successful mission or enforce blacklisted ideas for self-censorship, the agency teaches its trainees how to manufacture consent in the American public.

\entry{CIA} {Abbreviation} {Noun} {

It is often claimed in print that the CIA (Central Intelligence Agency) predicted the beginning of the Ukraine war. It is true. The CIA forecast Russia's full-scale invasion less than two weeks in advance. \footnote{ It is hard to imagine a time before the \emph{Kyiv Independent}, the newspaper the \emph{Wall Street Journal} tapped to cover the Ukraine war with the immediacy the U.S.-led NATO alliance demands for its rolling propaganda. \textukrainian{\emph{Українська правда}}, however, is one of the few Ukrainian newspapers whose history of publication precedes the struggle for Ukraine. It is thus a newspaper preceding the \emph{Kyiv Independent}'s coverage on the Ukraine war. It published the majority of the articles covering the CIA's predictions. In one of these articles, the headline describes the attack to be within days: \textukrainian{"Байден вважає, що Путін може напасти на Україну в найближчі дні} – The Guardian," \textukrainian{\emph{Українська правда}}, 11 \textukrainian{лютого} 2022. The first of these is reporting on \emph{The Guardian}. It is a reference to the \emph{The Guardian}'s article published on February 11th under the title, "US warns of ‘distinct possibility’ Russia will invade Ukraine within days." Reporting on \emph{Der Spiegel} revealed the date: ["\textukrainian{ЦРУ назвало імовірну дату нападу Росії на Україну} – \emph{Spiegel}," \textukrainian{\emph{Українська правда}}, 11 \textukrainian{Лютого} 2022]. A reference to the \emph{Der Spiegel}'s article published on February 11th under the title, "CIA rechnet mit russischem Angriff kommende Woche," the so-called \textukrainian{імовірна дата} could not have been vague in German. Another published a day after these read: ["\textukrainian{Головні новини п’ятниці та ночі: ймовірний напад Росії, санкції РНБО}, \textukrainian{\emph{Українська правда}}, 12 \textukrainian{Лютого} 2022"].} In the publications in Ukrainian, Hebrew, Russian, or English, the majority of the accompanying images are pulled directly from an article published seven years ahead of its time. On Mar 9, 2015, \emph{Stratfor} published its famous article, "Gaming a Russian Offensive." The scenarios the CIA discusses in its forecast are replications of those from \emph{Stratfor}'s article. The arrows in these sets of images follow those in \emph{Stratfor}'s article.  \newline \indent It is interesting how these new images spiral outward from a common source almost like a Fibonacci sequence, adding more arrows with the fractionalization of the original scenarios.  In one of the articles published by \textukrainian{\emph{Українська правда}}, the newspaper reports on February 12th how \textukrainian{"Росія має 9 маршрутів сэргнення до України, танки можуть сягнути Києва за 2 доби - розвідка США"}. A few of these nine routes, as impractical as the aforementioned fractionalization, could not have been farther from the truth, as the Russia massed scores of Russian troops on the highways into the Donbas, where the majority of the fighting raged for years before Russia launched its full-scale invasion. These three additional scenarios exceed \emph{Stratfor's} original six.

There is no preacher like him; no preacher has ever delivered a sermon like his on America. In his sermon, Sam Davis presents a critique of the United States unparalleled by contemporary Christians insomuch as he is not afraid to speak his mind about America; he is not gnat, fly on the wall, or cicada; he not a man with mere interpretations but a man with an opinion articulated from within the framework of his belief system. \newline \indent In the vast majority of cases, Christians unlike Sam Davis are fanatically loyal to the status quo ante in the United States without any of the conscious sense of morality Jesus Christ\footnote{It is important to note that far less than being a member of the Jewish community, Jesus Christ was far more a subject in the Roman Republic. In the scenes of the bible, Jesus Christ confronts the inequities in the Roman Republic's rule over Jerusalem.} himself preached against empires. \newline \indent If you compare Sam Davis to many of the tele-evangelists like Joel Osteen or to the white, rich privileged publicist Christians like Craig Groeschel\footnote{Groeschel's books like the \emph{Christian Atheist} sell for nothing but their impenetrable superficiality.}, the disparity is so shocking that anyone with a sense of wit to himself or herself cannot help but be so shocked as to entertain momentarily the well-founded suspicion that Sam Davis may not be a skeptical Christian mystic at all but an anarchist anti-Christ. \newline \indent Joel Osteen's vision of America is roses, smiles, or money; he is filthy rich; he wears a black suit; he praises the Lord like a man whose never had to drink from a glass jar or sleep with an extra blanket for lack of electricity but Sam Davis' view of America is history, dates, facts with a discussion of American debt. Why would a Christian like Sam Davis question\footnote{Romans 13:9; Exodus 20:13-15,17; Deut. 5:17-19,21} but not submit to the governing authorities? Unlike Joel Osteen, Sam Davis presents a unified theory of assassination on the assassinated presidents, Abraham Lincoln and John F. Kennedy. Davis claims members of the Federal government assassinated Abraham Lincoln\footnote{One of the most interesting claims that Sam Davis makes relates to the American civil war. Davis claims that America's civil war was not about slavery or freedom, States' rights or the centrality of the Federal government but money. He cites as evidence of the hypocrisy of the Northerns the governor of Maine. Samuel Cony, who served as the 31st governor of Maine from 1864 to 1867, was an abolitionist but Thomas Jefferson, who fathered four children with his 14 year old enslaved African American wife, was an abolitionist according to a rejected draft of the Declaration of Independence where he condemned the King for his support of the practice. Davis claims that Lincoln sought to seize the South's assets to facilitate America's repayment of its debt to France in the Treaty of Alliance from February 6th, 1778.} for his relation to America's debt. Davis claims John F. Kennedy was assassinated for his decision to eliminate the basis of a "pledge in reorganization" (i.e., the decision to create a currency backed by a precious metal) after John F. Kennedy signed Executive Order 11110 in law on June 4, 1963.\footnote{} Sam Davis claims that upon birth America's ruling elite enter into a ledger a pledge in the amount of 650,000 dollars guaranteeing an American's debts unto death on a person's Social Security number wherein the Federal government trades on "the souls of men" from Revelation 18:13.}

While offering a new interpretation of Hume's famous "Of Miracles," which notoriously argues against the possibility of miracles (i.e., in an ontic or epistemic sense), Earman tries to show how Hume's argument is admittedly unoriginal or undeniably meritless where original. By situating Hume's popular argument in the context of the 18th century debate on miracles, Earman tries to show how Hume's inductive inference is naive. Earman's primary argument rests on probability calculus. The issue Hume addresses is, namely, how is belief to be apportioned when uniform experience conflicts with eyewitness testimony? Earman criticizes "the quest for a criterion to clear genuine science from pseudo-science." In his evaluation, "the history of these twin quests" has been a failure. He understands the failure to mean, namely, "whether the assertion merits belief and whether the enterprise is conducive to producing well-founded belief." His solution rejects a "simple litmus test" for a proposal encompassing a "detailed, case-by-case investigation." (2000; pg. 3) Comparing Charles Berlitz's \emph{The Bermuda Triangle} (1974) to Larry Kusche's \emph{The Mystery of the Bermuda Triangle-Solved} (1986),  Earman calls such investigations often "unrewarding" and "downright tedious." Ultimately, Earman adjudicates Hume's argument to be an "abject failure" for its unreached ambiguous and confused goals.} Is Putin's 2025 summer offensive an "abject failure"? Is an "abject failure" a project whose unreached goals are confused or ambiguous? Is Putin's 2025 summer offensive a project whose unreached goals are confused or ambiguous? \newline \indent It is unclear from the article in the \emph{The Economist}. It doesn't make sense to talk about a third, if one cannot about a second or first. The article makes no mention of the previous three offensives, when they occurred, how they started or how they ended, which goals the offensives sought to achieve or whether these goals were military objectives, a part of a broader strategy or aligned with a plan for victory in terms military analysts utilize to understand war.

The most likely set of data is based on multiple projects running simultaneously in the field of artillery.

\entry{Gantz, David M. } {} {} {A detailed, thorough, insightful military historian of the eastern front, Gantz is one of the U.S. Army's untapped resources America's intelligence never managed to consult prior to the transformation of Julia Nuland's successful 2014 Maidan \emph{coup d'etat} into a full-scale provocation.\footnote{In an article published in \emph{Foreign Affairs}, John J. Mearsheimer, a veteran, under the title, "Why the Ukraine Crisis is the West's Fault," lays "most the of the responsibility for the crisis" on the United States and its European Allies. The taproot of the problem, Mearsheimer argues, "is NATO enlargement, the central element of a larger strategy to move Ukraine out of Russia's orbit and integrate it into the West." ["How the West Provoked Putin," \emph{Foreign Affairs},"See America: Land of Decay and Dysfunction," September/October, 2014] "For Putin, the illegal overthrow of Ukraine's democratically elected and pro-Russian president-which he rightly labeled a "coup"-was the final straw. He responded by taking Crimea, a peninsula he feared would host a NaTo naval base, and working to destabilize Ukraine until it abandoned its efforts to join the West."} Gantz's book, \emph{Operation Barbarossa: Hitler's Invasion of Russia 1941} provides a detailed historical account of the failed German offensive launched on June 22, 1941 against the Soviet Union. }

\entry{gay divorce} {} {} {The lack of gay divorce in American society is a multifaceted conspiracy against heterosexual couples, child birth, and the nuclear family. In contrast to homosexual couples, heterosexual couples are required to consummate a marriage within a State but the modern American state where American heterosexuals consummate marriage, is designed less to ensure matrimony until death but to profit from the eventual destruction of the family until death. The lack of gay divorce, however, safeguards homosexuals from the parasites that cling to the nuclear family; gays are not required to marry so they are not required to divorce. They're free to move from one relationship to another or the dominant homosexual is free to continuing dominating the subdued homosexual.\footnote{A great many of the subdued homosexuals in homosexual relationships look for a way out of the relationship but the fact that the subdued homosexuals are necessarily in place to guarantee at least one aspect of the multifaceted conspiracy against heterosexual couples forbids the modern American state from pondering the considerations at its disposal for the emancipation of the subdued homosexual. It would not make sense, for instance, for the modern American state to allow subdued homosexuals to exploit the generally accepted justification for females. A subdued female homosexual filing a petition for a restraining order because she wants to prevent her dominant homosexual partner from "rapping" her undermines the utility value of "rape" for married women with a male husband. A certain degree of steadfast definition, the likes of which gay divorce threatens, is required to guarantee the overall utility value of heterosexual divorce for the conspiracy. The result is that dominant homosexuals, male or female, are able to continue to dominate their subdued partners, maintaining control over the relationship, children, or property. It means that homosexual relationships provide a far more powerful role in American society for a dominant personality to persist than a heterosexual marriage. Consequently, homosexual relationships are far more private, consistent, or maintained than heterosexual relationships because none of the partners have a recourse or remedy the modern American state would like to exploit for its voracious appetite of destruction.} \newline \indent The modern American state manifests the vast majority of these parasites, celebrating their existence with honorific titles as though they were contributing value to society when in all reality they are merely hastening its destruction for personal gain. These parasites are the "family" law lawyers, social workers, judges, or Courts, the vast majority of which could not function for gay divorce for lack of marriage, children or property but for marriage, children or property now find meaning as a "family lawyer," a "family law judge," "child social worker," not from heterosexual marriage but divorce. Not only do heterosexual divorces sustain a major function of the parasitic police state bureaucracy (i.e.,"family" law lawyers, social workers, judges, or Courts) but make a tremendous amount of money from their hosts, sucking their blood for years on end. In comparison to the amount of money generated from gay divorce, heterosexual divorce is a major market for the State; "family" lawyers file petitions for dissolution, child social workers concoct diagnoses for prescription medicine from therapy sessions charged to the dissolution, "family" law judges make rulings, the "family" law Courts produce opinions.\footnote{The fact that Americans do not read the opinions appellate Courts issue not just on family law but on all matters concerning the Courts is one of the major reasons Americans remain in the dark about the trappings of the modern American state; of the ones who are capable of reading, few of these interest themselves in the opinions of the Court, even though these are promulgated.} Homosexuals are not only immune from but do not contribute to the amount of money the State extracts from the labor value of familial dissolution.

\entry{great powers} {} {} {In the years following the French Revolution in 1789, the regional European powers began to form nation-states with France, the most influential military power in Europe during the Napoleonic war, leading the way. Germany, in its own right, evolved primarily from the Kingdom of Prussia into a unified nation-state through successive acquisitions from the time of Fredrick the Great to the end of the Paris Commune in 1871. In 1871 Germany finally defeated France. These two regional European powers, France and Germany, thus emerged from the Battle of Waterloo on June 18, 1815, the end of the Napoleonic Wars, to fight each other for dominance on the continent well past the 19th century. The Franco-Prussian War (1870-1871), which triggered a seismic shift in Europe's power dynamics. Germany's celebration of its unity in Versailles after the acquisition of the Alsace-Lorraine humiliated France, establishing Germany as Europe's strongest continental power, set the stage for the rivalry that drove these two nation-states to begin World War I in the 20th century. While during the 19th and 20th century a feature for distinguishing a nation-state from a great power became not only the possession of overseas colonies but a great naval fleet. \newline \indent In the 21st century great power competition emerged among the most well armed nuclear powers for access to, control over or exploitation of trade routes, raw materials, rare earths or minerals, or currency, precious metals, or commodities. Countries such as the U.S., Russia, China, France, the United Kingdom, India, Pakistan, North Korea, Israel, and Belarus, whose status is a result of Russia's decision to share its own missiles with the country, remain the world's nuclear armed powers. Alongside these countries, a number of non-nuclear armed regional powers, however, began to earn the status of a great power through the lucrative arms trade. In the production of arms, munitions, infantry fighting vehicles, armored personnel carriers, tanks, howitzers, Panzerhaubitze, one way kamikaze aerial or oceanic drones, heavy weapons such as shoulder fired anti-tank surface-to-air missile, weapon systems, anti-air defense systems, fighters jets, corvettes, frigates, destroyers or air craft carriers, countries have begun to stratify the basis for power in region after region throughout the world. \newline \indent Egypt, for instance, began to develop its defense industrial complex at an alarming rate before the fourth anniversary of the Ukraine war, demonstrating its ability to outclass its not only its Arab neighbors to the west but its Arabic speaking non-ethnically Arab neighbors to the southwest, south, or south east; Egypt's ability to engage in the arms trade at scale has begun to intensify its competition with neighboring powers in the Middle East such as Israel. While neither Egypt nor Israel are able to create fighter jets, Egypt's ability to create a frigate certainly provokes comparison with Israel's naval power, since Israel has a robust fleet with a history of excellence in shipbuilding but crucially without an example for an Israeli built frigate. \newline \indent Before the third anniversary of the Ukraine war, Turkey, another non-nuclear armed nation-state, began to produce the TAI TF Kaan Stealth Fighter, its own fighter jet. Turkey is one of the few countries in the Mediterranean producing its own fleet.\footnote{Türkiye exports its fleet. It delivered to Ukraine two Ada-class corvettes, the Hetman Ivan Mazepa on October 2nd, 2022 and the Hetman Ivan Vyhovskyi on August 1st, 2024. The nation-states capable of exporting units from its own fleet are stronger than those that cannot but produce new units for nothing more than their own fleet.}

Isn't Robert Greene's book on the 48 laws of power capable of providing an intelligence agent with a view into the power relations separating Russia from the U.S.-led NATO alliance in Ukraine? Is the Ukraine capable of being explained by any of Greene's laws? If so, which laws explain the Ukraine war from beginning to end. While women in search of a new way to boost their lucrative image\footnote{Even women at the age of 62 are profiting from boosts to their lucrative image on Instagram.} hit the gym after reading his self-help book, the book is unsurprisingly absent from analyses on the Ukraine war. A wide spectrum of commentators, analysts, agents, researchers have reported on the Ukraine war; many have reported time and time again without reference to any of Greene's laws; many have reported time and time again on blogs, Telegram channels, in newspapers, or in books but few to any at all have ever thought to deprive the underlying causes of the Ukraine war from an application of Greene's laws. It is almost as though Green's book, celebrated on Instagram by scantly clad women the world over, is irrelevant for the politics of the 21st century. How could such an influential book influence the analyses of the Ukraine war so little? Is it mere coincidence? Is it causality? In what lies the irrelevance of Greene's 48 laws of power? How are Greene's 48 laws of power irrelevant for what is the central, defining, most historically encompassing, greatest political, economic, societal event in the history of the 21st century? The outcome of the Ukraine war decides not only one of the four primary unresolved post-Soviet conflicts in the ever collapsing breakdown of the U.S.S.R. (i.e., in countries such as Transnistria, Nagorno-Karabakh, or Georgia) but the fate of the future of the future redivision of the collapsed Ottoman Empire. Its importance for the United States, Europe, the Middle East, Africa, Russia or Eurasia simply cannot be underestimated. }

\entry{insider trading} {} {} {During the Ukraine war, the Trump administration sought to sign into law a bill restricting "insider trading" for Congressmen.\footnote{The original bill only applied to lawmakers; it was co-sponsored by Sen. Bernie Moreno, R-Ohio. The bill was originally titled the “PELOSI Act,” a reference to past accusations by Republicans that former Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., whose benefit from inside information in stock trading not only increased the wealth in her portfolio but provided the insider with an opportunity to influence Pelosi's decision making in Congress directly. The actual title of the bill is S.1879 - Ban Congressional Stock Trading Act. Who is former Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif.? She is a heinous psychopath whom members of the left wing of the State security apparatus call 'mama bear,' a nickname that epitomizes the psychopathy at the heart of the left wing of the State security apparatus. In his own articles on Pelosi, David North spares no compliment. Having served in the House since 1987 for California's 11th congressional district, most of San Francisco, Calif., Pelosi's history of legislature in the House of Representatives reveals a surprising lack of distinction in its dearth of reform. Has Nancy Pelosi ever passed legislate to improve San Francisco, California or America?} The law is not just a stupid charade designed to temper the Democrats against the Republicans; it is not a "marvelous state of the art tactic."\footnote{In a long lost collection of political pinups from the 1980s, \emph{Hardball}, Chris Matthews, a contemporary Machiavellian politician, enunciates how "[behind] those vaunted closed doors lies not only the paraphernalia of power but a distinctive language. It is a world of tough old alliances, Gothic revenge and crafty deal-making, but also of marvelous state-of-the-art tactics such as spin and positioning." Matthews' Washington lexicon is among the most colorful for political pundits but he suffers from false consciousness; his belief that Trump's January 6th attack on capital hill was not a Federal conspiracy orchestrated by America's State security apparatus undermines his lack of clear depth on American politics.} It is far more sinister. It is nothing more than a new instrument for the police State bureaucracy\footnote{The U.S. is not an exemplar of organic solidarity. It is thus legitimate to suppose that from time to time the police State bureaucracy in the U.S. may or may not align with a Presidential Administration.} to exert control over Congressmen, since the bill subjects Congressmen to Federal criminal prosecution. A congressman who is accused of "insider trading" after an investigation may, nonetheless, escape Federal criminal prosecution, should the Federal government's Attorney General decide not to file charges at all; after all Federal criminal prosecution is but a selective, non-compulsory, discretionary process anyway.  Even the threat of an investigation into a Congress member's "insider trading," however, would be enough to exert control over a Congressman. There is the crux of the matter. Since the Attorney General is under the direct authority of the President, a Presidential Administration could therefore blackmail a Congress person engaged in "insider trading" (inadvertently or on purpose) with the threat of an investigation or even criminal charges.\footnote{The trend during the past few decades, however, has been for Democrats to file charges against Republicans or vice versa so that the promise of a pardon at the changing of the guard guarantees a party's power over the party member. It is a sinister way to whip American politicians, the vast majority of whom are engaged in one or another form of corruption, into submission.} Trump's bill thus effectively provides the Federal government's Executive Branch with more influence over Congressmen than any previous bill, thereby tipping the scales in the system of checks and balances.  \newline \indent Directed at controlling rather than regulating the influence of 'special interest' on Congressmen, special interest thus nonetheless remains. A special interest may, for instance, bribe an Executive Branch's Presidential Administration to permit a Congressman's "insider trading." Should the bill pass, special interest would thereafter be required to conduct the business of insider trading through the Executive Branch rather than directly through individual members of Congress. Trump's bill merely reroutes the path of least resistance from Congressman or Congresswoman to the Executive Branch. Neither members of Congress nor special interest escapes the Executive Branch; either way the Executive Branch benefits from Trump's bill. \newline \indent While insider trading must certainly be the subject of regulation, there are two problems with the so-called PELOSI Act; the first is, as mentioned, the expansion of the Executive Branch's control over members of Congress; the second is its prevarication\footnote{The PELOSI Act is even more problematic, if you consider a blind trust to be problematic; a blind trust is a legal arrangement that gives a trustee control over your money and property without your knowledge or input. A possible workaround could easily be to refer the insider to trustee's law firm. The insider could coordinate insider trading with the trustee's law firm, since the language of the PELOSI Act covers the relationship a prospective trustee of a Member of Congress' blind trust is so broad as to exempt a trustee's law firm; if the trustee himself or herself has no personal knowledge of an interested party obtaining knowledge of any trust property other than the initial property of the qualified blind trust, then the trustee cannot be subject to enforcement. Given the complicated nature of the more than five requirements for \textsection 13162.(f)(3)(A-E), no Member of Congress is likely to submit the required notice on his or her own but through a lawyer. Should the noticing lawyer be involved, his or her law firm could easily contact the trustee's law firm to coordinate insider trading; therefore neither the noticing lawyer nor the trustee would have personal knowledge of the insider trading. It is clear from  loopholes like these that the PELOSI Act is neither a stupid charade nor a "marvelous state of the art tactic" but a bill carefully crafted to ensare the American public in a vile deception of reform.}; the PELOSI Act solves nothing; it merely shifts power over insider trading from members of Congress to the Executive Branch without a solution for the root case of the problem of special interests. \newline \indent A truly effective way to regulate special interest would relate to none of the three branches of the Federal government, all of which have become totally subordinate to the will of a thin layer of America's richest oligarchs, but to the electoral system itself. The fact that campaign finance remains largely unregulated undermines the central principle of equality in American elections. A candidate, whose ability to raise more money than his or her competitors guarantees his or her election, simply bypasses his or her constituent electorate altogether. If a new electoral system were to limit campaign finance to a low threshold with a requirement for candidates to engage in seven four hour long debates live streamed on the Internet from locations throughout a city, a county, a state or the nation, elections might reach a level of engagement on par with Abraham Lincoln's debates with Stephen Douglas from 1858. A candidate would never be able to simply bypass his constituent electorate. \newline \indent In 1858, Lincoln confronted Douglas before large audiences in seven places throughout Illinois for several hours: in Ottawa on August 21, in Freeport on August 27, in Jonesboro on September 15, in Charleston on September 18, in Galesburg on October 7, in Quincy on October 13, and in Alton on October 15. The newspapers covering these debates not only republished these debates but provided analyses. So important were these debates that Lincoln felt the need to memorialize them in a book. \newline \indent America's current debates, including the one now raging over the PELOSI Act (which ignores most of the important issues), are not worth the paper they are printed on but a series of seven debates in a new electoral system with campaign finance limited to a low threshold would marginalize whatever money a special interest might like to utilize for bypassing the electorate.\footnote{A special interest could still attach itself to a candidate but in the form of pledges. If a special interest's candidate wins, the special interest could realize its pledge. These pledges could be designed to sponsor a public work project such as building a library, endowing a university with scholarships, improving a park, or completing a project aimed at the common good. The vast majority of the money special interest spends on American elections in the current system is swamped, wasted, spent down the drain, on the election itself rather than on the electing community. Advertisements, for instance, are an excellent example; an advertisement for a candidate in an election loses its relevance for a community after voting; it contributes almost nothing to the community's common good, being biased, prejudiced or partial. A pledge, however, has the advantage of outliving an election. A tendency for skinflint must replace America's propensity for spendthrift in elections, lest the country continue to waste money on what are arguably elections rigged by America's State security apparatus. The election of U.S. Representative, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, for New York's 14th congressional district on June 26, 2018, for instance, resulted from an election engineered carefully to ensure its outcome; the Democratic Socialist of America (DSA), the New York chapter of which Ocasio-Cortez represented, is an instrument of the Federal Bureau of Investigation so America's State security apparatus rigged that election. Confirmation of its status as an instrument of the Federal Bureau of Investigation comes in the form of the denunciations the Socialist Equality Party, a more sinister instrument of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, made against AOC.  Similarly, Zohran Mamdani, a member of the New York chapter of the DSA, won an engineered election in 2025 during the Ukraine war to become New York's mayor. If elections in America like Ocasio-Cortez's and Mamdani's are already rigged by its State security apparatus, the money spent during an election would be better invested in the community than in campaigns. After the campaigns matter less for competition between candidates than for the presentation of a facade of democracy. Isn't it a bit extravagant to spend millions of dollars on a facade of democracy?} It would turn the election away from special interests towards the electorate. It would level the playing field. It would further democratize America's republican system. It would make America great again.}

\entry{Knuth, Donald} {} {} {Before the beginning of the AI revolution, algorithms dominated the curiosity of people interested in computer science. In one of the greatest books yet written on the subject of algorithms called "The Art of Computer Programming" (TAOCP), Donald Knuth famously announced how "[the] best way to communicate from one human being to another is through a story."\footnote{"The Computer Scientist Who Can't Stop Telling Stories". \emph{Quanta Magazine}.  April 19, 2020.} Knuth's book spans no fewer than four volumes over more than three decades of publishing. There are seven fascicles for the fourth volume alone. Volume 1 (Fundamental Algorithms) is published in 1997, Volume 2 (Seminumerical Algorithms) in 1997, Volume 3 (Sorting and Searching) in 1998, Volume 4A (Combinatorial Algorithms) in 2011, Volume 4B (Combinatorial Algorithms) in 2022, Volume 4 with Fascicle 1 (Bitwise Tricks and Techniques, Binary Decisim Diagrams) in 2009, Volume 4 with Fascicle 2 (Generating All Tuples and Permutations) in 2005, Volume 4 with Fascicle 3 (Generating All Combinations and Partitions) in 2005, Volume V with Fascicle 4 (Generating All Trees-History of Combinatorial Generation) in 2006, Volume 4 Fascicle 5 with (Mathematical Preliminaries Redux, Backtracking, Dancing, Links) in  2018, Volume 4 Fascicle 6 (Satisfiability) in 2015, Volume 4 with Fascicle 7 (Constraint Satisfaction) in 2025. Knuth's emphasis on the idea that programming is less a science than an art turns the idea of computer science on its head. Called "the father of the analysis of algorithms,"\footnote{Karp, Richard M. (February 1986). "Combinatorics, Complexity, and Randomness". Communications of the ACM. 29 (2): 98–109. doi:10.1145/5657.5658} Knuth's work into algorithms, the design of programs to decide how to achieve an objective through the performance of a specific series of tasks in the shortest possible period of time with the least amount of resources, is a seminal work in the 21st century.\footnote{Knuth is also important for an altogether different reason. Knuth is responsible for creating the \LaTeX  program responsible for the typesetting of the present work. It is one of the many conveniences for which an entire generation of students, doctorates, researchers or scholars are indebted the world over, as the the \LaTeX  program is one of the cheapest, easiest, most elegant ways to typeset a book for self-publication in the history of the world.} It is not so much that Knuth's book is a radical departure from the analysis, pedagogy, or design of algorithms. It is that his book, written by a single author, brings together the various thoughts on algorithms into a single compilation, much in the same way that Euclid's \emph{Elements} organized the achievements of geometers like Pythagorus into a single book. Therein lies his contribution. \newline \indent Knuth's ability to produce a four volume book with a fourth volume containing no fewer than seven fascicles is more a result of his obedience to the ruling elite than his own abilities. Knuth, for instance, has been able to enjoy years of tenure at Stanford without the interference, interruptions, or disruptions that the search for new employment causes when members of America's police state bureaucracy swoops down on dissidents like vultures to deprive him or her of life, liberty or the pursuit of happiness in acts designed to embody the anti-Constitutional spirit of the anti-American regime.\footnote{ Can a graduate student without stability produce a volume work on a single subject over the course of more than three decades? Hundreds of thousands of American graduate students, especially women, are subjected years of prolonged periods of time without a position, stable employment, a research assistantship, stipend, scholarship, or grant, the basic prerequisite for the expressed development of human faculties over time. The interference, interruptions, or disruptions are designed to stymie intellectual development in the United States so that even the ability to express thought becomes subject to the police state bureaucracy's myriad levers of control. The employment of the United Auto Workers' union in the United States, which is one of the many levers at its disposal, actively seeks to ensure that graduate students are not only imprisoned in a prism of control but can escape only at the expense of their entire career in academia. The ruling elite, who employ the lowest levels of the Lumpenproletariat in the ranks of the UAW, are happy to watch aspiring graduate students sink below the level their intellectual promise suggests they reach. It is but one of the many ways the police state bureaucracy in the United States undermines its own people.}}

These are "Mob and Riot Control" (1964), "Watts: Riot or Revolt?" (1965), etc... But "Riot Makers" represents a breakthrough in the divulgence of its political ideology.} an investigation into the cause of so-called racial disturbances on campuses during the 1960s hardly makes any mention of the fact that at time of the so-called riots the U.S. continued to conduct a fruitless, destructive, wasteful, illegal war against Vietnam without a reasonable justification for the slaughter. Providing a timeline of what the film makers call "major riots" following the 1964 Harlem unrest, the film is an obvious attempt to cover the Federal government's complicity in the assassination of the great Martin Luther King Jr.'s death in 1968, the death of man whose initial journey began with protests against racial inequities but ended with calls for social equality, the true motive and motivation for the Federal government's decision to murder the greatest speech maker of the 20th century. \newline \indent While the film makers attempt to set aside both social as well as economic causes for the outburst of social discontent, the film's true objective is to assassinate multiple characters with a single clip from a long reel of film. The film labels figures like Abbie Hoffman, Rennie Davis, or Tom Hayden\footnote{} as purveyors of a new type of trained agitators called "Leninoids" after Vladimir Iliych Lenin.\footnote{The accusation actually more undermines Lenin, whose objective in his book \emph{What is to be Done?} is not to create new protest leaders but anchor the working class struggle firmly within the center of orthodox Marxist theory by combining the hierarchical transformation of the Great German General Staff's organization principle for theoretical militancy with a modern 20th century political party, than sheds light on these nameless political figures.} It had absolutely nothing to do with riots. While the film makers claim the American Leftist movement had its roots not just in the Soviet Union but in Hitler's Germany, the film presents little to no evidence of these claims. It claims "each provocateur was a 'graduate engineer in social demolition,' the techniques the film makers attribute to these riot makers (which is a fairly accurate assessment of their political activity) are precisely the ones agencies like the Federal Bureau of Investigation used against dissidents throughout the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s, as detailed in numerous books on its Cointelpro\footnote{FBI Director Hoover's general COINTELPRO (COunter INTELligence PROgram) directive intentionally trained agents to "expose, disrupt, misdirect, discredit, or otherwise neutralize" the activities or leadership of the working class movements they infiltrated with the aim of preventing workers from 1) exercising any rights such as those enumerated in the Bill of Rights, 2) exerting any influence over the politics of the state, or 3) in any way "exposing, disrupting, misdirecting, discrediting, or otherwise neutralizing" the activities of the Federal government's insistence on maintaining authoritarianism at any or all costs. 3) The emphasis on maintaining a monopoly on violence is simply not enough; violence, however gentle or harsh, has never been enough for the execution of the Hooverites; it must focus on the preservation of the highest order of authoritarianism so that the State never returns to a democratic Republic led by representatives elected by the population in any shape, size, or form but remains firmly within the hands of those most committed to securing the preclusion of any political party differing from the one the Democrats form with the Republicans together with the suppression of any voice opposed to the status quo ante. 4) The COINTELPRO program unleashes the gates of hell, anything Dante Alighieri could envision to be the basis for eternal condemnation to one of his lowest circles in hell, to guarantee the usurpation of the direction, development, or constitution of objective consciousness so that workers, whom the FBI's agent chain to the wall of a cave, see nothing but shadows on the wall.\footnote{"Their riotmaking methods follow a time-tested formula and the results are as predictable as what happens when the chemist drops drops a block of sodium in water and creates an explosion," the FBI narrator says. Spoken as though from a legal framework, the FBI's narrator continues, describing how there are three elements in "riot making."  "First," he says, is "the putting together of an organization and deploying workers where they can be the most effective." Secondly, is "getting the masses of people ready and in the right frame of mind to riot." Last but not least, he leaves no doubt to his purpose when he mentions the "riot itself." While in the 1960s, 1970s, or 1980s documentaries like "The Riot Makers," might have informed candidates, now these documentaries instruct agents on how to adopt the Riot Makers' tactics for inducing workers to fail, just as Noam Chomsky's \emph{Manufactured Consent}, once a critique suddenly became a playbook for agents. The trend among modern day anti-Constitutional agents of the State has been "to flip the script" on critics, rabble-rousers, radicals, or revolution so that the subversion of a revolutionary struggle becomes a means by which the State not only deprives citizens of basic, human, civil, or Constitutional rights but perpetuates its rule over society no matter how far the rulers of that society disintegrate the millennia of social gains working people without the means of production have fought to preserve, from Magna Carta to the remnants of the Civil War, from the American revolution to the French Revolution, from the Paris Commune of 1871 to the Bolshevik revolution.} Light must be shut out with darkness completely so that no worker escapes the degradation of consciousness that keeps him or her chained to the wall.} campaigns to smash alternative news media. Nowadays the FBI can only evoke the daydreams of its past with new amalgamations such as "black identity extremist." The exposure of the FBI's role in many left wing organizations during these three tumultuous decades provides further evidence for its complicity in their creation. The U.S. makes its own boogeymen. \newline \indent The narrator is one of the most vile Hooverites imaginable. His definition of a riot is a direct attack on the Bill of Rights' right to assemble, designed to denigrate an American's right to exercise his or her right to nothing more than anarchism. The sanctity of a practical understanding of Hannah Ardent's definition of totalitarianism implemented in the U.S. must be the unutterable Big Lie that every agent of the FBI must make his or her mission to preserve.}




\entry{Light} {} {} {In one of the future developments of the Ukraine war, fiber optic drones, which are less susceptible to Directed Energy Weapons, High Powered Microwaves, or Electro-Magnetic Pulses, are expected to undergo a further transformation with the incorporation of light into the various components responsible for its flight. These components, mostly onboard electronics which are currently subject to disruption from a DEW, EMP or HPM, are expected to be designed with light. \newline \indent Light offers notable advantages not merely beyond immunity to these types of weapons. In terms of its ability to program realities in mathematics, light is capable of being configured to exhibit the properties theorized in group theory. For instance, passing light through a clear lens can serve as the unit; black lens as null; various other lenses as functions. \newline \indent  If light is a manifestation of the same phenomena as electricity, the binary principle of denoting a sequence of hexadecimal numbers with bits may be just as photonic as electric. If the mathematical rules for representing mixtures of colored light can be represented with photonics, these may exceed the spectrum of the binary principle. A mixture of light would allow for a new type of computer logic to develop. It would allow for intermediary states. In his treatise on \emph{Electricity and Magnetism} from 1873, James Clark Maxwell\footnote{A grand statue of Maxwell in the city of Edinburgh, Scotland, his birthplace, with a wooden dowel composed of the three primary colors from his famous experiment in his hand.}, one of the greatest post-Enlightenment scholars of physics before Einstein, describes light as governed by the same phenomena that govern electricity and magnetism, unifying these concepts in his equations.A central processing unit whose cores are based on light rather than electricity will significantly enhance not only the speed but the power of computation. Since light is governed by the same phenomena as electricity (i.e., light is an electromagnetic wave), light should be able to provide for a more complex type of computing beyond the electrified binary principle because light may not only emulate but mock electricity with its myriad number of states. A computer is nothing more than a state machine. If the number of states can be expanded beyond ones or zeros to colors from light, the state machine would exceed the electrified binary principle. Since red, green, and blue are primary lights, the three different lights can represent three different states with mixtures of the lights being intermediary states so programmed. These mixtures can, in turn, serve as functions for groups, rings, or fields manifested with a complex of light than with ones or zeros. It is really easy to imagine how the properties of groups may be represented in terms of Maxwell's theory of light. \newline \indent Not based on a flashing beam of light triggering a one or a zero as the present day design for photonic processors dictates, CPUs designed with a Maxwellian photonic core (MPC) are expected to exceed the power of intermediary states in the superpositions of cubits from quantum computing. The present type of flashing beam of light ignores the fact that Maxwell proved light to be composed of primary colors, whose differentiation, rather than a flashing beam of light, is the basis for intermediary states.  
\newline \indent Let us suppose, for instance, that an equation for the set of colors resulting from operations on the three primary colors is the following: c ≡ xR + yG + zB, where c, the color resulting from the operation, R, G, B, standing for the three primary colors (Red, Green, Blue), with the amount of these primary colors designated by the corresponding lower case letters, x, y, z (i.e., the ratio of its illumination\footnote{James Clark Maxwell demonstrates in section 3, equations 1 through 5, "the ratio of its illumination" in the famous article the Royal Society of London published in 1860. (pp. 62-63)} ), records the result of the operations. The lower case letters, a, b, c, are thus the measure of c. In terms of the set of all the possible colors of c, we shall designated that set by the capital letter, C so that all colors c so resulting from the operations on the three primary colors shall be therein contained. It thus follows from Maxwell's explanations that the behavior of the set of colors C are algebraic. Namely, the set C displays the properties of a group. We shall enumerate the properties. (C, *) is a group, since associativity holds for R * (G * B) = (R * G) * B for all R, G, B in the set C; moreover, there exists an identity element e of C such that R * e = e * R for all R of C; for any R, G, B there exists a color a to the negative 1 of C such that a * a to the negative 1 equals a to the negative 1 * a equals the identity element. Since (C, *) holds for R * G equals G * R for all R, G of C, the set of colors is an abelian group (i.e., a commutative group). 
\newline \indent It is absurd to have faith in the idea that quantum computing spells the end of cryptography, since quantum computing would give rise to quantum cryptography. The whole idea of cryptography, however, is paranoia. The information States hold secret are hardly ever so recondite that open source analysis cannot uncover a hint. If an archaeologist is able to imagine the reconstruction of an unknown dinosaur from a single bone fragment, a hint obtained from open source analysis can easily reveal the entirety of a secret. 
\newline \indent In the ninth edition of the Encyclopædia Britannica, published in 1875 in 24 cloth volumes, Maxwell laid out his understanding of the atom.

No weapon has wielded more power on the battlefield than the Magura, since no weapon has accomplished what the Magura has accomplished. In the aftermath of Bakhmut-Artemovsk, the Ukrainians lost complete control over the Black Sea. Shortly after losing control, the Ukrainians fought their way back by constantly iterating on the Magura drone, improving specific features until Russia lost more than half of its Black Sea Fleet, withdrawing the remainder to the port city of Novorossisk in Russia, far away from the Ukrainian Magura drones. The Magura drones represented one of the most sophisticated threats to sea vessels in the history of warfare. The Magura's ability to strike larger, more expensive, time-consuming constructions like ships such as corvettes, frigates, destroyers, etc... represents the essence of the drone threat, the ability to cause an enemy such irreplaceable loss that its restoration, several times the cost of the drone, takes more time than is feasible for its effect to impact the outcome of the war.

\entry{Manhattan} {} {} {Qinghai is a province in China where the Talatan solar project is constructed. With enough power to provide energy to every household in Chicago, the project boasts 16,930 megawatts. During the Ukraine war, it continued to expand. In fact, it is still expanding, adding panels with a target of growing to 10 times the area of Manhattan in three years.\footnote{["Why China Built 162 Square Miles of Solar Panels on the World’s Highest Plateau," \emph{New York Times}, October 30th, 2025.]} Another 4,700 megawatts of wind energy and 7,380 megawatts of hydroelectric dams are nearby. Manhattan is useful benchmark. In contrast to China, America, whose inability to build large scale infrastructure projects is optimized in California's more than two decades on a rail project without a single line of track, builds data centers without solar projects. While data centers are expected to account for 8 percent of all U.S. power by 2030, America's insistence on leveraging the existing electricity, which is in a downward death spiral, for improving AI leaves little reason to have faith in its ability. Meta's planned 5-GW data center in Richland Parish, Louisiana, known as Hyperion, for instance, is expected to ultimately exceed the size and energy demands of just lower Manhattan alone. It is easy to see that in a situation where the Chinese are expected to generate three times the size of Manhattan with the Talatan solar project, America has no plan but to add to a decrepit electricity grid an additional data center less than the full-size of Manhattan.\footnote{[The Architects of AI Are TIME’s 2025 Person of the Year," \emph{Time}, December 11th, 2025].}}

Describing the situation in Russia after the United States sanctioned Lukoil and Rosneft on October 22, 2025, Steve Rosenberg, the BBC's Russia correspondent, posted a tweet to X with a video on November 17th, 2025.\footnote{[\@BBCSteveR:1990481916949062026]} In the video Rosenberg displays the inner page of a famous Russian tabloid, \textrussian{Московский Комсомолец}, with a picture of mannequins, stripped, bare naked, save the leggings. Above the picture of the mannequins is a title that reads: \textrussian{Без Одежки Протягивай Ножки}. Below the title, the subtitle reads: \textrussian{В России закрылся каждый второй магазин одежды и обуви}. The cover of the newspaper derides the Russian tourism industry for trying to sell a trip to the Taiga for the price of a Turkish holiday. \newline \indent The crescendo, however, comes not from the mannequins but from a critique of Russia's \textrussian{гиперинфляция штрафных санкций}. Rosenberg reads the following lines: \textrussian{Скорее всего о проблеме дефицита госбюджета на судебных процессах представители обвинения рассказывать все-таки не будут.

Вместе с тем если решать оперативную задачу повысить содержание золота в яйцах, которая, очевидно, имеет несколько вариантов решения, путем фактического уничтожения дающих эти яйца куриц, то это, как представляется, так себе государственная политика.} These lines, discussing what are hardly statistics or hard numbers, illustrate how sanctions have begun to harden Russia's domestic policies.}

\entry{Manstein, Erich von, the 2nd Conquerer of Sevastopol} {} {} {Since neither a Roman nor a n Ottoman commander captured the Cimmeria before Prince Grigory Aleksandrovich Potemkin-Tauricheski, Erich von Manstein, the Nazi general, became the 2nd Conquerer of Sevastopol after the city fell on July 4th, 1942. History, however, may call the general the first conquerer, since Manstein is the first to conquer the city, established by Catherine the Great, after its Russification into a naval fortress to assert her Empire's control over the Black Sea. 
\newline \indent Manstein conquered the Cimmeria with his personal dedication to one of the underlying principles of Blitzkrieg. He observed how the battle, which had raged for the better part of a year, began to tip the scales in the Nazi's favor.\footnote{During World War II, the U.S. Army's Military Intelligence Service initiated a series of reports on the Axis' powers. Among these reports is one dedicated to \emph{The German Armored Army}. The author expounds on the core tactical doctrine of German armor, explaining how "both from a tactical as well as from a strategical point of view, the selection of the maneuver to be carried out must always be inspired by the desire to disconcert the enemy command through its very boldness and rapidity. If necessary, 'what seems most improbable must be accomplished at the improbable place,' as remarked an officer of the staff of the 1st Armored Division in justification of the maneuver at Sedan." The author continues, stating: "By spectacular and even horrible combat methods, one must annihilate any will to resist on the part of the enemy. The fury of the "Stukas," the whizzing of their bombs, the din of their machine guns, the onrush of the tanks, the thunder of their march and of their fire, the spurt of the flames from the flame throwers, the explosion of melanin charges, everything must be brought into play to affect the morale of the combatant and give him the impression of an "apocalyptic" scene." Published on August 10th, 1942, Special Series \textnumero{ 2} is one of the U.S. Army's first explications of the Nazi's lightening warfare. What is fascinating about the term is just how flexibly its composition rendered absolutely new concepts to the German lexicon. In a depiction of the unbelievably expurgated cartography of Nazi campaigns from a book published in 1942 in \textgerman{Mǔnchen}, Germany, under the title, \textgerman{Der Krieg in Karten: 1939/1941}, the word \emph{Blitzsieg} comes to define the outcome of the battle over the Balkans from April 6th to the 30th, 1941 for the editor, Giselher Wirsing. Under the title, "\textgerman{Der Blitzsieg auf dem Balkan}" (pg. 24), an abstract depicts a lightening victory "\emph{aus dem Handgelenk heraus}." The German word victory, \emph{Sieg}, rhymes with war, \emph{Krieg}, indicating how the flexible nature of the German language accorded with dynamic concepts of German warfare, easily creating new terms.} At precisely the moment when the scales began to weigh more heavily on the Nazis's side than the Soviets', Manstein commanded elements of his 11th Army to make the improbable possible with a cross-channel raid on Severnaya Bay where the Soviets estimated the chances for a successful attack to be highly improbable. In a reverberation of Manstein's sense for the appropriate place at the most opportune time like his modification of \emph{Fall Gelb}'s plan to pass through the Ardennes on May 10th, 1940, Manstein's correct appreciation for Napoleon's advice to maneuver according to circumstance prevailed.\footnote{It stands to mention that one of the unmentioned principles of \emph{Blitzkrieg} is harmony. In the Special Series \textnumero{ 2}, the author emphasizes how "it would be an error to compare one weapon with another. Far from encouraging rivalry among the various weapons, the new organization has developed their \underline{harmonious} association, and utilizes the motor to give them previously unrealized possibilities of speed. Armored weapons (light or heavy), infantry, artillery, engineers, signal communications, not to mention the air forces-all these arms contribute to the common aim: overcoming the adversary by an irresistible assault, followed by a complete destruction." \newline \indent Over the years, Sevastopol witnessed fewer conquerers than Jerusalem, the famous center of the world.}

\entry{The Minimalist Program} {} {} {Developed by Noam Chomsky in his last iteration of his system of generative grammar, the Minimalist Program is one of the most fascinating curiosities ever developed in the scientific study of language. In the wake of its immediate debut, a number of linguists leveled important critiques against the program, the most famous of which Shalom Lappin wrote in 1997.\footnote{Johnson, D., Lappin, S. A Critique of the Minimalist Program. \emph{Linguistics and Philosophy} 20, 273–333 (1997). \cite{https://doi.org/10.1023/A:1005328611460} Lappin's critique signified the end of the days when large telecommunication companies like AT\&T, Bell Laboratories, or the IBM T.J. Watson Research Center employed Ph.D. graduates to conduct research into the study of subjects related to communication, representing the end of an era in America's history of telecommunications. Neither AT\&T nor Bell Laboratories continue to employ Ph.D. graduates. It is a shame, since the practice produced great work like Lappin's critique of the Minimalist Program.} Chomsky, who intolerantly refuses to respond in kind to critiques, has simply ignored Lappin's critique for the better part of three decades, demonstrating how academia is less about the emendation of the intellect, reason, or Enlightenment than about the preservation of powerful, ideologically aligned, irrationally committed groups of scholars who are ready to champion a leader's framework than subject that framework to the rigors the framework itself requires in its application to its subject of study. \newline \indent The problem the Minimalist Program faces is similar to the problem the greatest contributors to the study of being face at the end of the Renaissance. The inherent assumption that grammar is innate is akin to that of Descartes' in his famous statement: \emph{cogito, ergo sum}. AI, however, obliterates Chomsky's Cartesian dualism\footnote{A celebration of Chomsky's Cartesian dualism is the auditorium at Eindhoven, the Dutch Republic of Letters, where Noam Chomsky debated the famous French philosopher, Michel Foucault on October 22nd, 1971 at 7:30 p.m. The Eindhoven University of Technology's auditorium, the host states in the documentary of the debate, contains glass, "the inner and outer world blended together." He explains how during the broadcast, unique to modernity for its audacity, "you could see traffic outside passing by. Symbolic, indeed," the host says, "because the relationship between inner and outer world is central to the first half of the fourth philosophers debate about human nature and the ideal society." During the debate, Foucault espouses a fully Cartesian point of view when he separates human thought from the history of ideas, as though people haven't ever had any ideas, or, at least, no one who could think hasn't thought without them. Foucault, the narrator says, does not associate "the history of thought ... with the history of ideas or even the development of the mind, but rather it should be understood as discontinuous transformations," as though an Epicurean atom in Lucretius struck another suddenly giving rise to the advent of a new structure in society but without the underlying forces of nature drawing one electronegative atom to another in a bond like water. Foucault's discontinuous transformations transition "from one network to another." \newline \indent In the debate over the individual, however, the narrator raises a question for these Cartesian dualists, the likes of which is relevant to the 21st century. He asks: "To what extent is the individual able to discover something new - and, if so, how should we make sense of this?" The question is point, since humanity rather than any individual, despite reports to the contrary, has uncovered a huge treasure in the form of Artificial Intelligence. The discovery of Artificial Intelligence, hardly on the minds of these two interlocutors at the time of the debate, is not "something new" an individual can discover by himself or herself but the product of a massive transformation not only in humanity itself but in human society. The productive forces, the likes of which have not been higher than they are now, have come together after an arduous series of trials and errors to produce a consortium of different products (such as the computer, Alternating Current) coordinated to supply mankind with the one thing it champions for its distinction from animality: reason. To the extent that the systems for Artificial Intelligence such as the competitors have created have sought nothing but reason, the ability to discover something new such as AI is a human endeavor. It is not the result of Alan Turing's "Computing Machinery and Intelligence," a paper published before the creation of Large Language Models, but humanity's. If humanity is responsible for AI, then the implications for Cartesian dualism, for Descartes' own \emph{Cogito, ergo sum} could not be any less significant then as now. In terms of humanity's achievement, the \emph{Time} magazine, which is interested less in truth than propaganda, has assembled as list called "The Architects of AI" for 2025 where the list focuses on the people America's ruling elite have selected to deliver messages about AI than about the actual truthfulness of its generation. (i.e., December 11th, 2025) The magazine shamelessly omits the hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of working class developers whose keystrokes, software, problem solving skills, or eight hours of work per day held the entirety of the Magnificent Seven on their backs like the Titan celebrated for holding up the heavens, Atlas. \newline \indent Foucault's critique of the history of science is therefore a supremely ominous forecast of the Platonic state of man, especially now for AI. Foucault says: "Within the traditional history of science, the creativity of individuals has been accorded maximum importance. The history of science up until recently essentially consisted of showing how an individual, whether it was Newton or Mendell, had been the creator rather than discoverer of reality that was already existing in things and in the world, a reality that no other person had previously discovered. I believe the postulate that lies at the core of the traditional history of science is that truth exists in order to be known. Yet the human mind, due to the effect of a number of inhibitions or obstacles, has not managed to see this truth. The mind is made to see the truth and a contingent obstacle is impeding him to see it." Foucault's explanation is thus a modern reiteration of Socrate's Allegory of the Cave from Plato's \emph{Republic}. (514a-520a, Book VII) While he has a different explanation for the different type of chains holding the uninitiated at the bottom of the cave, Foucault's emphasis on the sun's light draws him back to Ancient Greece.} with the production of grammatically sound sentences. It should be that a new program based on the idea that language reaches its unity within society rather than individual speakers giving rise to a greater reflection of the nature of speech and reality. In program where speakers are but a part of a whole, the reduction of a speaker's grammar such as a Spanish speaker's developing intuitions for English grammar naturally clash with those of native English speakers, whose speech is subject to the societies in which he or she is most active. The new program for an examination of grammar rests on setting Chomsky's own minimalist program up against itself so that the historical residues of a language like the English's use of Latin neuter nouns continues to impose the Latin case system on English in much the same way that the Germanic monosyllabic English verbs, all of which are irregular with an unpredictable stem vowel change, still exert influence over English verbs. Setting up individual grammars up against each other such as a Spanish speaker's developing intuitions for English grammar against those of a specific community will bring put the Minimalist Program into motion.}

\entry{mite, a} {} {} {In his beautifully crafted long essay, \emph{Pensees}, Blaise Pascal has the following to say about a mite\footnote{Is Pascal's remark about a mite at all related to a line from Surah Al-Baqarah Ayat 26 in the Holy Quran?}: "But to show him another prodigy equally astonishing, let him examine the most delicate things he knows. Let a mite be given him, with its minute body and parts incomparably more minute, limbs with their joints, veins in the limbs, blood in the veins, humours in the blood, drops in the humours, vapours in the drops. Dividing these last things again, let him exhaust his powers of conception, and let the last object at which he can arrive be now that of our discourse. Perhaps he will think that here is the smallest point in nature. I will let him see therein a new abyss. I will paint for him not only the visible universe, but all that he can conceive of nature’s immensity in the womb of this abridged atom. Let him see therein an infinity of universes, each of which has its firmament, its planets, its earth, in the same proportion as in the visible world; in each earth animals, and in the last mites, in which he will find again all that the first had, finding still in these others the same thing without end and without cessation. Let him lose himself in wonders as amazing in their littleness as the others in their vastness. For who will not be astounded at the fact that our body, which a little while ago was imperceptible in the universe, itself imperceptible in the bosom of the whole, is now a colossus, a world, or rather a whole, in respect of the nothingness which we cannot reach? He who regards himself in this light will be afraid of himself, and observing himself sustained in the body given him by nature between those two abysses of the Infinite and Nothing, will tremble at the sight of these marvels; and I think that, as his curiosity changes into admiration, he will be more disposed to contemplate them in silence than to examine them with presumption."}

\entry{North-South Corridor} {} {} {During the Ukraine war, the International North-South Transport Corridor (INSTC), one of the railways at the heart of the the world's richest millionaires, centi-millionaires, or billionaires fighting to assert supremacy over the global supply chain of great trade routes, expanded rapidly throughout Eurasia, enumerating brand new statistics for installed rails, shipments or the types of shipments. While the ultimate aim of the North-South Corridor aims, like most of all the Eurasian trade-routes, to establish a land route from Russia through Eurasia to India, one of the largest global markets in the history of the 21st century, the North-South Corridor's significance for its expansion into Russia's immediate or proximate neighbors gained importance in the face of the U.S.-led NATO project overthrow Russia's European trade routes on the European continent\footnote{The Ukraine war accelerated European commerce on the continent. A 29 billion dollar megaproject to build the longest single rail tunnel in the world suddenly went underway, as the war roared on. The tunnel is designed to connect Lyon in France to Turin in Italy; the current route through the Alps is based on an 18th century design full of twists and turns; the tunnel is expected to optimize trade from truck to freight. Called the Mont Cenis Base Tunnel, it will exceed the Gotthard Base Tunnel in Switzerland by half a kilometer. Evidence that the Ukraine war is responsible for the project's acceleration is the document entitled, Commission Implementing Decision (EU) 2025/1715. Published on July 30th, 2025, the document required the "implementation of the Lyon-Turin cross-border project on the Mediterranean European Transport Corridor," mandating its completion.}, a process whose development follows closely the key milestones in Russia's full-scale invasion of the Ukraine.\footnote{In an exceptionally telling post on how the Ukraine war has resulted in a redrawn energy map on Sky News Arabic, a subtitle describes how "the first shot in the Ukraine war killed the energy map." (i.e., \textarabic{الرصاصة الأولى في حرب أوكرانيا قلبت خريطة الطاقة إلى الأبد.}) [SNABusiness: 1706965512322797576; September 27th, 2023] In this video, Sky News Arabic explains how the first bullet in the Ukraine war killed the pre-existing energy map in Europe, rerouting Russia's trade routes away from Europe to Eurasia. In turn, the U.S. routed its supply of energy to Europe. Algeria became a new supplier to Europe. ["Chevron Explores Algerian Gas Plans Amid Russian Sanctions," \emph{Wall Street Journal}. February 6th, 2023], ["The Unexpected New Winners in the Global Energy War," \emph{Wall Street Journal}. September 19th, 2023] In the initial aftermath of Russia's full-scale invasion, the West immediately imposed sanctions on the Russian imports for gas, coal, or oil, ending centuries of European reliance on cheap Russian energy. Slowly but surely the U.S. began to wean the countries less ideologically aligned to NATO off Russian energy. These are countries like Slovakia, Hungary, Romania, Bulgaria or Serbia. Later the U.S. successfully terminated Russian exports to Europe almost altogether, at least as far as the Ukraine as a transit hub is concerned. There can be no doubt that Russia's full-scale invasion served as an incredibly timely excuse to implement a plan, the likes of which Condalezza Rice espoused in an interview from 2014. In the interview, Rice the following: "Now we need to have tougher sanctions and I'm afraid at some point this is going to probably have to involve oil and gas. The Russian economy is vulnerable. 80 of Russian exports are an oil gas in minerals. People say well the Europeans will run out of energy. Well, the Russians will run out of cash before the Europeans run out of energy and I understand that it's uncomfortable to have an effect on business ties in this way but this is one of the few instruments that we have. Over the long run you simply want to change the structure of energy dependence; you want to depend more on the North American energy platform, the tremendous bounty of oil and gas that we're finding in North America; you want to have pipelines that don't go through Ukraine and Russia. For years we've tried to get the Europeans to be interested in different pipeline routes it's time to do that and so some of this is simply acting and acting as quickly as possible."} Russia initially expanded its railways to North Korea, a country whose shipments of war materiel have helped, some argue, an advantage in artillery over the Ukrainians. Russia continued, adding more countries. On September 12, 2023 Russia dispatched 36 wagons to Saudi Arabia through Iran's Icheh Borun border. \newline \indent Considered to be the result of a joint partnership for sending cargo contains via the INSTC from the Formacheva railway station via Akyayla (Turkmenistan) to Incheh Borun, the route facilitates the path container trains take from the southern Ural railway stations to the port city of Bandar Abbas via Sarakhs or Incheh Borun. On October 2nd, 2023, a Russian train containing 31 wagons had traveled 1, 610 kilometers on Iran's railway in three and a half days to arrive at the Iranian port city, Bandar Abbas Central District of Bandar Abbas County, Hormozgan province, Iran for shipment from there to Saudi Arabia by sea.Russia's chosen route reduced customs tariffs to almost half the normal price, breathing new life into the Iranian rail transport industry through an increase in the share of transit goods the Islamic Republic of Iran's railways enjoys. The train travelled through both Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan before reaching Iran. It bypassed the alternative maritime route through the troubled Suez Canal that the dwindling naval power of the United States could no longer guarantee in the face of the Houthi's unrelenting attacks on container ships. On November 5th, 2025, Russia exported refined oil in the form of different types of fuels such as gasoline and diesel to Afghanistan via Iran. Russia's diesel fuel shipped from Russia to the Iranian Caspian seaport of Amirabad; from Amirabad to Mashhad; from Mashhad to Afghanistan on the semi-finished Khaf-Herat railway.\footnote{The Khaf-Herat railroad is a 225 km standard-gauge (1, 435mm), non-electric rail line linking north-eastern Iran to western Afghanistan. Proposed in 1975 to transport iron ore from nearby mines in Afghanistan to Iran, the railway is one of the many projects the Taliban government revived after an ugly American withdrawal on August 30, 2021 during Biden's war administration.}  \newline \indent The INTSC connects the major economies on the Eurasia to Russia. Articulated in Russia's strategy for the country's fundamental supply chain,\footnote{["\textrussian{Новак: транспортный коридор "Север - Юг" станет основой для цепи поставок в России," \emph{ТАСС}, 21 апреля, 2022 года}.]} the INTSC represents a major shift in the history of global trade in Eurasia.\footnote{Alongside the INSTC, which is a primarily Russian dominated trade, are the trade-routes on Eurasian railways leading to China. On May 25th, 2025, the first freight train from Xi'an, China, arrived at the Iranian port city, Aprin, a historic milestone for the development of Sino-Iranian relations. The historic land route reduces the time by sea from 30 to 40 days to 15 days by rail. The reduction of the journey by 15 to 25 days represents the immensely powerful transformation domination of a land route in Eurasia imparts to its ruling power. These statistics indicate that China theoretically doubled the amount of its transit goods. Alongside China, Saudi Arabia, one of the many centers of power in Eurasia, announced the issue of tenders for a 1,000-mile railway between the Red Sea and the Persian Gulf for linking Saudi Arabia's oil giant, Aramco, from Jeddah on the Red Sea through Riyadh to the country's east coast ports in a move designed to bypass the Suez Canal altogether. Shortly before the fourth anniversary of the Ukraine war, Riyadh began to construct its land-bridge, signifying how by coincidence or causality the Ukraine war became witness to changes in Eurasia's trade routes that are expected to influence mankind for centuries.["Saudi Arabia to Seek Bidders for 1,000-Mile Red Sea-Gulf Railway," \emph{Bloomberg}, September 18th, 2017] It is hard to imagine how quickly history began to move in the face of the Ukraine war but even countries with a much lower profile than Saudi Arabia such as the United Arab Emirates, whose significance is addressed in a separate entry, traversed a new land route for its trade. [Red Sea Attacks Force Firms to Test New Land Routes via UAE, Saudi, \emph{Bloomberg},February 2nd, 2024] } A salient feature of previously oceanic routes becoming territorial is a Suez Canal\footnote{The Suez Canal underwent a fundamental transformation during the Ukraine war. Prior to the Ukraine war, the Suez Canal dominated shipping lanes for Eurasian countries transporting goods to or from the Mediterranean to the Persian Gulf. During the Ukraine war, major shipping companies such as Hapag-Lloyd began to call for the utilization of territorial routes such as Saudi Arabia's land-bridge, as many major German newspapers, newsreels, or broadcasters announced. ["Hapag-Lloyd bietet durch Saudi-Arabien an," \emph{Der Spiegel}, January 22nd, 2024]} reduced in significance.

\entry{Nova} {} {} {Perhaps one of the longest running series in the history of television, if not broadcasting or streaming, \emph{Nova} represents the state of the art of America's ability to reach the heights of consumable, popularized, visual, free, scientific media. The most-watched prime time science series with a weekly viewership exceeding five million, the Nova series, which spans from Sun, Mar 3, 1974 to the present with no fewer than 51 series contains one of the many cornucopias of data the developing systems responsible for the growth of AI require to produce novel innovation. The first \emph{Nova} documentary broadcast less than ten years after the last episode in a series called \emph{The Bell System Science Series}. \newline \indent A predecessors to \emph{Nova} such as \emph{The Bell System Science Series} accomplished much to lay the groundwork for scientific exegesis. The Bell System Science Series consisted of nine television episodes lasting less than 30 minutes apiece made for the AT\&T Corporation\footnote{In the 20th century, companies like AT\&T, which were akin then to that of the Magnificent Seven now, funded major projects for America's cultural, scientific, intellectual development. The new corporate culture at companies from the Magnificent Seven has completely abandoned the American corporation's civic duty. None of the Magnificent Seven's companies have produced anything resembling the scope, importance, or power of the \emph{The Bell System Science Series}. The Magnificent Seven have contributed almost nothing to American culture. The vast majority of the activities of the Magnificent Seven have contributed nothing but to the expansion of America's police state bureaucracy with the creation of backdoors for America's police state agencies, departments, commission, offices, bureaus, or departments to utilize without a warrant in a massive expansion of the Federal government's ability to eavesdrop on their everyday activities like bathroom breaks or purchasing tampons. Is the Federal government now so weak that eavesdropping on bathroom breaks or tampon purchases is absolutely necessary for the maintenance of its power?} broadcast from 1956 to 1964. The episodes read more like Socratic dialogues with the characters asking each other questions than a storyline with characters who undergo changes in the face of an adventure. \newline \indent The first four are called Capra films after their producer, Frank Capra.\footnote{Prior to his production of \emph{The Bell System Science Series}, Capra produced seven episodes in a series on World War II under the eye of the War Department. These are Prelude to War (1942), The Nazis Strike (1943), Divide and Conquer (1943), The Battle of Britain (1943), The Battle of Russia (1943), The Battle of China (1944), War Comes to America (1945). Produced alongside the war, these films represented a considerable achievement in the visual arts. The 20th century is full of wars but few have ever received as much coverage as Capra's series.} Capra released \emph{Our Mr. Sun} in (1956), \emph{Hemo the Magnificient} in (1957), \emph{The Strange Case of the Cosmic Rays} in (1957),\footnote{One of the most curious aspects of the Capra films is the roundtable of puppets representing Fyodor Dostoevsky, Edgar Allen Poe and Charles Dickens, who apparently hosted a contest about the great mystery of matter and the universe. It is unclear why Capra selected these authors over all others, as few, if any, books they wrote ever deal directly with the question of matter or the universe.} and \emph{The Unchained Goddess} in (1958). Capra later described the films: "Those four films about science, hand woven with bits of celluloid, were sprightly patterns of poesy and fact; fresh ideas were their main charm, a rather elegant charm, we thought, much like the light-hearted but disciplined charm of a Mozart composition.\footnote{Capra, Frank (1997). \emph{The name above the title: an autobiography.} DaCapo Press. p. 443.} \newline \indent Warner Brothers took over production of the next four after firing Capra for his emphasis on a pedantic agenda designed to portray science as the "Holy Spirit."\footnote{The "Holy Spirit" is so elusive that Muslims claim Jesus prophesied Mohammed's coming in John 16:7-14 where the word interpreted to "Holy Spirit" is semantically unjustifiable within the context of the Ancient Greek koine. In Surah As-Saf Ayat 6 in the Holy Quran, the passage discusses the one from John.} Warner Brothers produced the next four in the series. These are \emph{Gateways to the Mind} in (1958), \emph{The Alphabet Conspiracy}, in (1959), \emph{Thread of Life} in (1960), \emph{About Time} in (1962), the last of which is undeniably a classic of unparalleled quality. There is perhaps no competing work capable of the depth of explanation the film achieves. Disney produced the last video, The Restless Sea, in (1964). These experiments, whose producers, screenwriters, or production changed almost per episode, laid the groundwork for future educational documentaries in the sciences in America.

\entry{Palantir} {} {} {A centralized intelligence agency deployed to the Ukraine war, Palantir has exploited the Ukraine for experiments with Artificial Intelligence since the beginning of the war, if not earlier. In an article published by \emph{Time} magazine shortly after the fall of Avdiivka on January 17th, 2024 under the title, "How Tech Giants Turned Ukraine Into an AI War Lab," Mykhailo Fedorov, Ukraine’s Minister of Digital Transformation, claims his “big mission is to make Ukraine the world’s tech R\&D lab.” In the article, Jacob Helberg, a national-security expert who serves as an outside-policy adviser to Palantir's CEO, Alex Karp, calls Palantir "the AI arms dealer of the 21st century.” (February 4th, 2024) \newline \indent In an interview with Tom Mackenzie on November 14th, 2025, Palantir's UK head, Louis Mosley, described how the Ukraine is a "research and development lab for AI" in the battlefield. Palantir cites "extraordinary acceleration" in military technology. Mosley likened the speed with which Ukraine is required to reach the bleeding edge of technology for military innovation to that of the Allies during World War II when Germany's strategic bombing on the United Kingdom brought about some fundamental discovery in radar.\footnote{Although it is unclear what is meant exactly by raids across the English Channel, an educated guess may be the Nazis' \emph{Vergeltungswaffen}. In \emph{Weapons of Weapons of Mass Destruction} Robert Hutchinson details how the Allies utilized SCR-548 "gun laying radar to automatically track and predict the V-1 flight paths." (2003; pg. 44) It is unclear what advances the Allies made or at what speed these advances were made. In World War II the major innovations in radar with the SCR-548 proceeded primarily from Allied 'strategic bombing.' An air enthusiast, for instance, claims General Quesada developed the SCR 584 radar system. Beneath a picture of Adolf Hitler behind Stuka dive bombers, the cover of \emph{Airpower} from Winter 1989, he writes: “In contrast, General Quesada innovated. He used the microwave early warning (MEW) radar and the SCR-584 anti-aircraft radar in several new and unplanned ways, building an entire command and control network centered around this new technology. He put radio intercept operations (Y-Service) with MEW and radio controllers to help win the air battle. To assist ground-attack missions, MEW operators coordinated with SCR-584 operators to provide navigation and precise control to fighter bombers. The wide-band MEW was used for long-range and area control, while the SCR-584, with its narrow beam, was used for close-range, precision work.” (Carter, 1989; pg. 26) During which of the Nazis' 'strategic bombing' did the English develop the SCR-584 radar system? Or did General Quesada develop the system for the Allies' own 'strategic bombing'?} \newline \indent Digital Transformation is a term developed before OpenAI's first release of ChatGPT. OpenAI's first release of ChatGPT transformed the algorithmic revolution\footnote{Ram Charan's \emph{Attacker's Advantage}, written before the OpenAI's first release of ChatGPT, details the algorithmic revolution. The attacker's advantage refers to the fact that an entity (like a business or individual) who is the first to act gains a strategic advantage over competitors. The ability to identify and exploit opportunities before others do, particularly in a rapidly changing environment, distinguishes an attacker from the attacked. (February 24, 2015)} into the AI revolution. Designed primarily for sales at technology companies, the term is a pitch for likening the failure to embrace the algorithmic revolution to Kodiak's refusal to digitize for photos. Kodiak's refusal to digitize its photos ultimately led to its extermination. It is term deeply involved in the theory of social Darwinism where the strongest companies adopt the latest, greatest, strongest differentiation for thriving against competitors.\footnote{The theory of social Darwinism for the Ukraine, however, is slippery slop. The Ukraine specially inferior to Russia in several important respects. Is that the right ethical or moral framework for understanding Ukraine's struggle against Russia or Russia's against Ukraine? The above mentioned article from \emph{Time} magazine, on the contrary, likens Ukraine's situation not to the evolution of species but the battle David fought against Goliath in the Old Testament. Which ethical or moral framework best describes Ukraine's or Russia's situation? Does the matter relate not to Darwin nor David but an altogether different struggle? Isn't David's pebble a much better analogy for a discussion about weapons? It is an example of a technologically advanced weapon for defeating a much larger, more powerful, more advanced enemy.} \newline \indent The rise of Karp is a response to the aftermath Edward Snowden's decision to leak to the American and internal press evidence of the Federal government's conspiracy to deprive citizens of the right to be free from unwarranted searches and seizures under the Fourth Amendment. In contrast to technology leaders like Tom Siebel, whose book on digital transformation dedicates no more than a few paragraphs to social darwinism with the remainder laser focused on the technology of his product at C3.ai, Karp's book is a politically motivated invocation for the Silicon Valley, the 8th Wonder of the World, to shift away from innovation for improving the state of the art in technology, the individual or society at large, to the promotion of a type of nationalism commensurate with the aims of imperialism. Karp's book, \emph{The Technological Republic}, advocates for technology companies to focus on solving problems related to the struggle of a nation-state to assert dominance on the global scene. \newline \indent Karp's book is based largely on an analogy. It compares the existing situation in the United States to that shortly before WWII, advocating for a resumption of the war years under Roosevelt. The problem with Karp's analogy is that the United States has underwent tremendous change. The ratio of debt to GDP during WWII for America's war machine during WWII represented a percentage far more manageable than the current. The current ratio of debt to GDP is 125 percent. During the WWII years the ratio was  Whereas in the period before WWII, the Federal debt represented no more than a fraction of GDP year over year, the Federal debt consistently exceeds GDP now.\footnote{The attempt to revive 'the Arsenal of Democracy,' whose rise alone during the Ukraine war consumes innumerable reams of paper, recently became the subject of a new book published by the Center for Strategic and International Studies. In his book, \emph{The American Edge}, Seth Jones argues for a resumption of the 'Arsenal of Democracy' in America. He bases his call for America's transformation on the same analogy as Karp's: American's 'Arsenal of Democracy' from the administration under Franklin Delano Roosevelt.} The technology before WWII is unlike technology now. AI, whose scope extends past digitization, algorithms, or automation, is a type of technology like no previous technology in the history of mankind. In contrast with previous types of technology (i.e., digitization, algorithms, or automation), AI is \emph{almost} sui-generis.\emph{The attempt to compare AI to consciousness is one of the most flawed analogies in the history of philosophy, since AI has absolutely nothing comparable to what might be called experience for human beings, the unity of cognition from birth to death in the form of memories. AI, for instance, is not borne; it does not die. It has no unity of experience.} It has the ability to create parts of itself on its own. No such technology existed during the war years. The fourth problem with Karp's analogy is quality of life. The idea that America's economy made Americans better off than before the war years is false. Higgs\footnote{[Higgs, R (1992), “Wartime prosperity? A reassessment of the US economy in the 1940s”, Journal of Economic History 52: 41–60.], [Higgs, R (1999), “From central planning to market, the American transition, 1945–1947”, Journal of Economic History 59: 600–23.], [Higgs, R (2006), Depression, war, and Cold War: Studies in political economy, New York: Oxford University Press.]} provides ample evidence that they were not. Most Americans, who labored during WWII, experienced what might better be called a sacrifice. Normal consumption dropped. Americans worked longer and harder. A significant number of Americans gave up life and limb to join the French and British fight Germany, Italy and Japan for parts of their defeated empires to be incorporated into America's. A fifth argument is that the establishment of the 'Arsenal of Democracy' is rooted in a legitimate concern over the implications Adolf Hitler's Nazi party had for the Enlightenment; since there is no comparable leader, party or regime, the modern call for an 'Arsenal of Democracy' lacks the political justification its past enjoyed.  Karp's analogy for a 'technological Republic' is a ploy to convince young Americans to shift away from self-improvement, societal good or technological advancement towards the pursuit of American nationalism, the aims of imperialism, or the establishment of the United States of America as the leading, undisputed, global superpower. \newline \indent Karp is one of the least convincing of all the founders installed in America's technology companies. He is really bizarre. His arguments are more a "pauper's brew of eclecticism" than the reflection of an intellectual dedicated to groundbreaking research. You do not hear major figures like Bezos, Gates, or Musk making stupid comments about national security. It is unclear why America’s bourgeoisie has so much faith in Karp to keep appearances.  Karp's argument about American police state surveillance, for instance, being superior to a state of inferiority with relation to China in terms of the global race for AI is a really more of a reflection of his exceptional ignorance of technology than national security.\footnote{["Palantir CEO Says a Surveillance State Is Preferable to China Winning the AI Race," \emph{Gizmodo}, November 7th, 2025]} In the history of technology, there is no precedent for the idea of a perpetually guarded invention. The atom bomb, for instance, is a perfect example here. In no less than four years after the United States dropped an atom bomb on Japan did the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics manage to build its own.\footnote{Hutchinson details how the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics managed to build its own atomic bomb in his book, \emph{Weapons of Mass Destruction}).} It cannot be that Karp actually believes achieving a four year advantage (give or take) is a sufficient basis to justify the Federal government imposing a systematic deprivation of the Fourth Amendment right to be free from unwarranted searches or seizures on the entirety of the United States, especially for Palantir. Palantir is nothing compared to the Bill of Rights. Had there never been a Bill of Rights in the first place, no tech company could have ever enjoyed the freedom Palantir has. Palantir's (theoretical, hypothetical, or conjectural) attainment of a four year advantage in the race for AI is not calculated to benefit American citizens but Palantir. Neither Karp nor Palantir have ever articulated how the attainment of an advantage in the race for AI over China may benefit Americans. The relative benefit a four year advantage in the race for AI (whose value cannot be assessed but to be below that of the power a nuclear bomb provides a state) relates least of all to a prospective justification for an acceptable relinquishment of a right in the Bill of Rights. No citizen believes the value to exceed that of his or her right to , life, liberty or the pursuit of happiness or to be free (from unwarranted searches or seizures). \newline \indent Karp's argument thus attempts to persuade Americans by way of fear that the concomitant loss of a right from the Bill of Rights is far safer than the ensuing lack of security China's attainment of an advantage in the race for AI might pose. His argument, however, is not only a work of poor intellectual craftsmanship but easily one of the least enthymematic of the scaremongering so commonly expressed in the mouths of post-9/11 American politicians. The mantra so frequently evoked in the endless stream of now unbelievably mistrusted American mainstream news on post-9/11 American politicians is to trade freedom for safety. Educated in the words of Thomas Jefferson, no American would ever trade his or her freedom for safety. America's decision to sacrifice safety for freedom in the American Revolution is epitomized in Thomas Jefferson's Declaration of Independence. Karp's argument is really about selling safety for lively profit from freedom's death. It is an anti-American subversion of one of America's founding principles. \newline \indent One of the other claims Karp raises is that an America's power relative to competitors determines the scope, number, or exercisability of an American's rights. He says, "You will have far fewer rights if America is not in the lead."\footnote{"U.S. must "absorb a lot of risk" in AI race, says Palantir's Karp," \emph{Axios}. November, 25th, 2025.} Karp's claim is hard to understand. Does Karp mean to suggest that Article III courts are less willing to provide American's their rights through judicial activism when the United States operates on the global scene without the dominant, leading, world historical decision making capacity a superpower enjoys? Is it so when the U.S. becomes only a competiting great power? Does Karp mean to suggest that as America's power relative to its ability to wield the bleeding edge on the technology of AI weakens so do an American's rights; if so, how? How is it that a change in America's power relates to that of an American's rights? Where does the ratio come from? On what is the ratio or proportion based? Does Karp mean that the Legislature rather than Article III courts will pass legislation reducing an American's rights, if and only if, the United States fails to assert power commensurate with what is needed to guarantee that removed right? How is it that Karp can claim that an American's rights depends upon America's power relative to competitors? How does that ratio or proportion work in a constitutional Republic like the United States of America? Is it possible to reduce Karp's ambiguous claim to a smokescreen? Is it Karp's intention to scaremonger Americans into the belief that access to, enjoyment of, or control over rights depends upon how often, how many, or to what extent he or she is ready to sacrifice a right for the United States to gain an advantage in AI and, if an American is able to secure access to, enjoyment of, or control over rights only when he or she sacrifices a right, which right is unknown, how is it that by sacrificing what is to be gained, an American's relations to his or her rights is thereby improved. Isn't that \emph{ex hypothesi}? How can an American's relation to his or her rights be improved by their sacrifice. Is that sacrifice limited, unlimited, temporary, permanent, complete, incomplete, total, or partial? It seems that analysis of Karp's claims leads inevitably to ambiguity, lack of clarity or obscurity. It is not that Karp is speaking about "Ukraine, ICE, Israel and generally telling the truth." It is that Karp's statements are incapable of being understood in any real sense of the word definition,\footnote{In his famous essay under the title, "An Essay Concerning Human Understanding," John Locke, one of the primary pillars upon which modern society builds the structure of an Enlightened society, says there are many types of words whose meaning does not meet the criteria by which a term \emph{defiendum} corresponds to a \emph{defiens}. Hume writes: "Languages are not always so made, according tot he Rules of Logick, that every term can have its signification exactly and clearly expressed by two terms." (III. iv. 7). Some words cannot be defined by other, "[for] if the Terms of one Definition, were still to be defined by another,  Where at last should we stop?" (III. iv. 5). Karp's claim, however, is not one of these indefinable types, since many different definable types are already so enunciated. The problem is that his claim is ambiguous beyond terminology.} claim, proposition, or inference.

\entry{Perelman, Grigori Yakovlevich} {} {} {Grigori Yakovlevich Perelman, a Russian Jew, is the greatest geometer of the 21st century. Born in the formerly besieged city of Leningrad, Perelman solved the soul conjecture in 1995, for which both Princeton and Stanford offered him positions but he rejected all of these universities for a position at the St. Petersburg Department of Steklov Mathematical Institute of the Russian Academy of Sciences, returning to his homeland. He worked there from 1995 to 2006. During that time, Perelman solved \textfrench{Poincaré} conjecture. Rather than waste his time on waiting for one of the journals mathematicians in academia must submit their work for enumerating lists of publications (that tenure committees utilize to decide tenure), Perelman resolved on an entirely different path. Perelman bypassed all of these journals, publishing his own work by himself on the popular website \emph{arXiv}. Perelman's decision was the first in many steps designed to demonstrate to his colleagues how the true pursuit of mathematics proceeds. Even though Perelman did not publish his findings in a major journal, Perelman's discovery of a solution for \textfrench{Poincaré}'s conjecture, nonetheless, earned him a place in the history of the greatest mathematicians in the history of the world. \newline \indent Since \textfrench{Poincaré}'s conjecture had been a famous open problem in mathematics for the past century, the International Mathematical Union decided to award Perelman a Fields Medal for his solution. On December 22nd, 2006, the scientific journal, \emph{Science}, recognized in Perelman's proof the solution to  \textfrench{Poincaré}'s conjecture as the scientific "Breakthrough of the Year," a first in the area of mathematics. Perelman, however, responded to the IMU with the following: "I'm not interested in money or fame; I don't want to be on display like an animal in a zoo." Perelman thereby rejected the Fields Medal. \newline \indent In his decision to reject the Fields Medal together with its prize of a billion pennies, Perelman performed an unparalleled service for all of humanity not just at that time, now, but for the future, for he made the IMU feel like what it is. One of academia's many zoos. \newline \indent In particular, academia is one of the institutions the ruling elite around the world weaponize to oppress the freedom of thought at all points throughout all aspects of human curiosity. Just like the great mathematician, Alexander Grothendieck, before him, Perelman rejected the institutions 21 century set up to identify, influence or control mathematicians. Grothendieck, who burned hundreds of papers he had written in his rejection of 20th century institutions, abandoned academia in its entirety to become a shepherd with a flock of sheep in the French countryside. Like Grothendieck, Perelman quit academia to live with his mother in an apartment in his hometown. \newline \indent It is clear from the behavior of these mathematicians, both of whom contributed immensely to the progress of human thought in different areas of mathematics, that the attempt to award their endeavors with prizes, rewards or trophies like the Fields Medal were met with rejection not because these mathematicians lack intelligence but for profound considerations over the ethics, morality, or standards of the field. It is certainly a sign of the times that the greatest geniuses, whose work soars above the great mass of people, have felt the need to reject everything these prizes, rewards or trophies symbolize. These things symbolize for Perelman, as they did for Grothendieck before him, all the trappings of a class dedicated to putting the freedom of thought behind bars like a caged animal.

The news story, entitled, "They're encircled, and we'll wait until they surrender, withdraw or die' where the \emph{Times} claimed "Ukrainian troops surround hundreds of Russian infantrymen reviving hope after a brutal summer and, they say, swaying Trump in their favor." \footnote{The last part lasted no longer than a few weeks. Centered on the discussion of Tomahawk missiles, the missiles never came off the ground in the U.S. The Ukrainians are still waiting for those Tomahawks months later.} The article is one of the least well designed disinformation campaigns in the history of the war. The charts the author provides are transparently false. The diagram that it provides of Dobropillia does not display a circle; it does not demonstrate by way of shapes what is encircled. It has a series of fortified lines. These lines are not connected in a circle or encirclement. It show arrows from Ukrainian counterattacks. While an encirclement may ensue from a series of counterattacks, an encirclement arises after the exploitation of weak point leads to a line hardened by defenses. There are no lines hardened by defenses after or between the counterattack arrows. The fire brigade, Azov, already reconstituted more than four times with more than four changes in its commander, was already dispatched to Pokrovsk's defense but alas changed little to nothing for the Ukrainians dying to protect Metinvest Holding, LLC's assets for "\textspanish{El 'Abramovich' de los miners}." It was a last stage for securing the city from collapse but the stage fell through the floor. The characteristic lack of Ukrainian command was highlighted in the article when the Azov commander admits how only after being locked into a room for more than two weeks with a joint HQ, Corps command was restored. In the middle of a pitched battle lasting months, the fire brigade arrives to restore the chain of command. It reads like a foregone conclusion.

These AI generated enumerations shall serve as a speaking indictment of the SEP's leadership on a factual basis for its complicity in terminating these struggles. Had the SEP's leadership not been complicit with the FBI's union collaborators in orchestrating these struggles, at least one or more of the struggles would have led to a completely different outcome.

\entry{'Spring' Counteroffensive} {} {} {The most peculiar aspect of Ukraine's 'Spring' counteroffensive, which well-known Ukrainian commanders call 'idiotic,' is just how well telegraphed its military objective became before its launch. The \emph{New York Times}, well before the Jack Texeira leaks, published article after article, detailing the 'Spring' counteroffensive's military objective, telegraphing to the Russians not only the upcoming offensive but its aim. In an article published in the \emph{New York Times} on March 8th, 2023, for instance, where the authors claim “Bakhmut is [the] Mercenary Group’s ‘Last Stand” in Ukraine, the authors say the “campaign will likely focus on the southern region of Zaporizhzhia, where Ukraine is building up forces, [as] Col. Roman Kostenko, a member of Ukraine’s Parliament who is serving in the country’s military, told Ukrainian television on Monday.” In another article published on March 13th, 2023 by the \emph{New York Times} under the title, “Kyiv Seeking to Evacuate a Town It Controls,” the logic, the authors write, is to capture “territory around Melitopol,” so that “Ukrainian forces [may] sever a Russian line of control from the Crimean Peninsula to the Donbas region.” On March 14th, 2023, \emph{the New York Times} in an article entitled, “Russian Attacks Yield Little but Casualties in Wide Arc of Ukraine’s East,” repeats: “the Ukrainians, anticipating a big influx of Western weaponry and fresh troops in the coming weeks and months, are widely expected to mount a counteroffensive." The article continues: "Analysts, Ukrainian officials, and even Russian commenters have suggested that it would come on the southwestern part of the front, with the Ukrainians [attempting] a push east from Kherson and south from Zaporizhzhia toward the city of Melitopol, hoping to sever the land bridge the Russians have seized that links the Crimean Peninsula to the eastern Donbas region.” Ukraine’s singular goal, we are told in an another article published on March 21st, 2023 with the title, “Little Time on the Battlefield to Dwell on Notions of Peace Talks,” is to bide time until Kyiv’s troops retake the initiative in the war. The “moment,” the authors explain, “remains unknown outside the close circle of the Ukrainian military high command.” It would seem that within the span of less than two weeks in March, 2023 the \emph{New York Times} exposed the Ukraine's  battle plans in their entirety well outside the close circle of Ukrainian military high command. Given the amount of time from March to June, four months, the \emph{New York Times} likely accomplished more for the exposition of Ukraine's battle plans than Russian intelligence itself. \newline \indent Finally launched in June, the 'Spring' counteroffensive started in summer. It lasted until November 2023 when multiple Armed Forces of Ukraine (AFU) brigades failed to penetrate the Russian Surovikin line along the Orikhiv-Tokmak Axis in Zaporizhzhia Oblast. Although the Ukrainian brigades advanced approximately 20km at the cost of 518 vehicles, including 91 tanks and 24 engineering vehicles, the Ukrainians never managed to breech Russia's first line of defense on the Surovikin line.\footnote{[“On One Key Eastern Battlefield, The Russians Are Losing 14 Vehicles For Every One The Ukrainians Lose,” Forbes, 14 November 2023]}

Appointed to the overall command of the Donbas theater immediately after Ukraine's great 2022 Kharkiv counteroffensive launched on September 6th, 2022, Surovikin began construction of the complex network of defenses immediately. In its concluding remarks on an analysis of the Surovikin lines, the Center for Strategic and International Studies stated: "Russia has constructed some of the most extensive systems of military defensive works seen anywhere in the world for many decades."\footnote{["Ukraine’s Offensive Operations: Shifting the Offense-Defense Balance," \emph{CSIS}, June 2nd, 2023.]} Composed of layers of defenses such as minefields, dragon's teeth\footnote{[\textarabic{أسنان التنين تكتيك روسي "قديم" لصد الهجوم الأوكراني المضاد،العربية،  : ٢٩ يوليو ٢٠٢٣}]}, anti-tank ditches, trenches, pill boxes, and other barriers designed specifically to entrap the incoming Ukrainian 'Spring' counteroffensive, the construction of the Surovikin lines relayed heavily a Russian advantage in equipment. The Russian BTM-3, a high speed, tracked, trench-digging vehicle based on a heavy artillery prime-mover chassis, digs trenches several feet deep. It is capable of digging 800 meters of man-sized trench in one hour in 3rd gear. The minimum radius is 25 meters. The Russian BTM-3, whose implementation in the construction of the Surovikin line exceeds all other equipment, is unparalleled; few, if any other nations, have vehicles such as these. 
\newline \indent A Russified response to warfare on the eastern front, the Surovikin line recalls the networks of fortifications the Russians utilized throughout the more than three centuries of warfare preceding the Ukraine war for protecting the road to Moscow. A series of ten  redoubts, defensive earthworks, designed to trap the Swedes in marshes during the battle of Pultova in 1709 is the first. The great redoubt at Borodino constructed under the auspices of one of Russia's most colorful generals, Mikhail Kutuzov, whose famous ability to defeat enemies, especially the Turks, in retreat cemented his preeminence in annals of Western warfare, upset Napoleon Bonaparte's bid to compel the Russians to capitulate in 1812. The earthworks one of Leon Trotsky's subordinates, Georgy Zhukov\footnote{\emph{The Great Commanders} (2003), an award winning expert portrait of six men, places Zhukov after Alexander the Great, Julius Caesar, Horatio Nelson, Napoleon Bonaparte, and Ulysses S Grant.}, one of the greatest Russian and Soviet military leaders of all time, built to prepare the Russian victory against the Nazis at Kursk on July 5th, 1943 is the third. Surovikin's construction of a major defensive network of earthworks thus places his generalship firmly and thoroughly within the line of the great Russian generals of the 18th, 19th, and 20th century. It is no wonder that Vladimir Putin sacked Surovikin, for Surovikin's preeminence unquestionably rivals all others in Russia right now, including Sergei Shoigu, Valery Gerasimov, and any other member of the Russian \textrussian{ставка}, not to mention Russian politicians.

In an article published on October 23rd, 2025, Viktor Dolgopiatov, who heads Burevii, a design bureau pioneering [an] emergent class of [weapons],the "average ground drone (UGV) in Ukraine, for example, has a life expectancy of just one week."\footnote{["Western drones are underwhelming on the Ukrainian battlefield," \emph{The Economist}]} With a lifespan far shorter than expected for the Switchblade-300, the weapon suddenly became obsolete. \newline \indent The rapid evolution of drone warfare prompted the U.S. Army to take note of its obsoletion. In February 2022, the U.S. Army issued its first notice, requesting sources to supply Switchblade 300s, perhaps indicating a desire to strike a balance in a cost benefit ratio. In November 2022 the Army issued its second notice, submitting a Request for Information (RFI) on loitering munitions, directly referencing the conflict in Ukraine, which “has clearly demonstrated the ability of unmanned systems at increasingly lower echelons of employment,” especially for “[delivering] lethal effects.” \newline \indent In contrast with the Shahed, whose versions, modifications or models are studied in detail by both sides, the United States has not developed a loitering munition with a degree of intensity comparable to the Russo-Iranian project's emphasis on iteration.

The collapse of Syria's Assad regime, a fifty year old dynasty, is a result of the Ukraine war. Unique among the results of horizontal escalation, the collapse of Syria's Assad regime is a coalescence of processes arising from the Arab Spring with those of the Ukraine war. \newline \indent Al-Sharaa, an extremely clever Arab, trained a special division of his troops in drone warfare shortly before he launched his lightening offensive from Aleppo to Damascus, indicating how an element of the Ukraine war (ultimately derived from the Azerbaijanians in the \emph{Nagorno-Karabakh} war over Armenia\footnote{} complimented others such as the withdrawal of Russia's Private Military Company, Wagner, from Syria.\footnote{[\texthebrew{רוסיה מסיגה את כוחותיה בסוריה וריכזה אותם בשלושה שדות תעופה כהכנה להעביר חלק מהם לאוקראינה. מעבירה בסיסים למשמרות המהפכה וחיזבאללה, תיק דבקה, מאי 6, 2022}]}, both a result of Russia's full-scale invasion. While coverage on Al-Sharaa's lightening offensive is scant, if not brief, other elements receive a great deal of attention in the newspapers. In the mainstream Israeli press, the newspaper, \emph{Maariv}, published a series of articles detailing how nearly twelve months before the collapse of Syria's Assad regime Iran began to reduce its presence in the country.%\footnote{\texthebrew{[חוששת מישראל? איראן מצמצת את נוכחות בכירי משמרות המהפכה בסוריה , מעריב, 01.02.2024]}, \texthebrew{[איראן חוששת מישראל וצמצמה נוכחות בסוריה, בכירים במשמרות המהפכה עזבו ,ידיעות האחרונות, 01.02.2024]}, \texthebrew{[בעקבות גל החיסולים: "איראן מצמצמת את הנוכחות שלה בסוריה" ,01.02.2024]}. This element, undoubtedly a result of Israel's decision to expand its war with \emph{Palestina} from the Gaza Strip to Lebanon, is less related to the Ukraine war than the other elements. It clearly illustrates, however, the Grand Chessboard. For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction in the zero sum cosmos. Alongside the fall of Bakhmut-Artemovsk, the collapse of the Assad regime represented one of the greatest moments in the geopolitics of the war.}

In his famous book, \emph{The Prince}, Machiavelli asked on which side of a scale containing one of two animals the challenge for a ruler ruling over people weighs most heavily according to a given situation. On one side, Machiavelli sets the fox. On the other side, the lion. The weaker of the two is supposed to represent \emph{cunning} without strength. The stronger of the two \emph{brute force} with intelligence.  According to Machiavelli, a prudent ruler must be adaptive, changing to new situations, as problems arise, acting as a fox "in order to recognize traps" and as a lion when he has no choice but to "frighten off wolves." Machiavelli argues that the lion, the one symbolizing strength over intelligence, "is defenseless against traps" while the fox, the one symbolizing cunning over brute force, "is defenseless against wolves" and other physical threats; an effective ruler draws on the necessary, though not mutually exclusive, attributes of these great beasts, to keep his crown.
\newline \indent It would not be fair to dismiss Machiavelli's analogy outright for imprecision but no analogy escapes reality unscathed; Machiavelli's is no exception. What is a trap? Who lays traps? Who benefits from traps? Is there not room for a hunter? \footnote{In his unparalleled contribution to the study of being in the \emph{Metaphysics}, Aristotle, for instance, criticized Socrates' theory of the forms by virtue of the third man; if man is man by virtue of his participation in the form of man, a second form for participation is required. A third form relating the form for participation to that of the participant is thus required. The process continues ad infinitum. Socrates' theory of the forms thus becomes a wind egg. (c.f., \emph{Theaetetus} 161a) Is there no third man argument by which great philosophers like the Jewish monotheist, Aristotle, might make to undermine analogies like Machiavelli's? Is it not plausible to imagine a hunter behind the scenes of the fox and the lion? } \newline \indent It is clear that Machiavelli's understanding of the scales of beastliness or animality is nothing but to be contained in the eye of the \emph{arbiter elegantiarum}. An example is an elegant debate. A trap laid for the public, the two jaws of the foot piece, designed to catch the minds of readers, came in the form of a measure designed according to its counter-measure, the two corresponding momentanae.  \newline \indent The article published on April 12, 2024 by the \emph{New York Times} under the title "The Math on Ukraine Doesn't Add Up"  (the measure) was written so as to be a measure for its pre-existing counter-measure. Senator Roger Wicker's memo entitled, "Production is Deterrence," with a publication date on April 22nd, 2024 is the pre-existing counter-measure. With the measure before its counter-measure appearing sequentially, the Republican Senators, J. D. Vance and Roger Wicker, successfully tempered a trap for swaying American public opinion about "the math" on a range of issues related to Ukraine's war \textfrench{matériel} away from disapproval to support for funding. The math, which adds up in Senator Roger Wicker's memo, doesn't in J. D. Vance's article but publishing the latter before the former allows for latter to appear as a refutation. The refutation, however, was designed according to what was to be refuted well ahead of time. Senator Roger Wicker thus tempered V. D. Vance to publish his article before his memo.  \newline \indent Since the American public is never informed about the backroom discussions centering on or the creation, revision, or conversations with newspapers about, these documents, the sequential nature of forming the measure according to a pre-existing counter-measure is entirely concealed from the public's eyes, just like a hunter's trap is concealed from a fox's or lion's feet. Out of sight, out of mind. Machiavelli's analogy is thus a great starting point for identifying the humanistic aspects of governance. Why would any one have any need for speechless beasts when so much is clear from speech alone? \newline \indent  Passage of the funding sailed through the two houses of congress onto President Biden's lap in no time.\footnote{["US House approves 61bn in military aid for Ukraine after months of stalling," \emph{The Guardian}, April 20th, 2024]; ["What the US Congress passed to aid Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan," \emph{Reuters}, April 23rd, 2024]; ["US Congress passes Ukraine aid after months of delay," \emph{Reuters}, April 23rd, 2024] } While the Republicans passed funding for Ukraine's war \textfrench{matériel}, funding made no apparent difference, as the Ukraine failed to change the status quo ante on the battlefield in any noticeable way. None of the Ukrainian newspapers, such as the \emph{Kyiv Independent} or \textukrainian{\emph{Українська правда}}, published articles, describing how the newly passed aid for Ukraine or its new war \textfrench{matériel} made much of a difference. \newline \indent The problem is neither the hunter nor the trap but the fact that for the most part the animals never really realize what being trapped truly means. The failure to realize one is trapped is related almost exclusively to the fact that trap's objective is less to trap than to reinforce entrapment. The design of opposites, the counter-measure for the measure, ensnares people into thinking that these opposed points of view are really an opposition. The fact of the matter is that beyond the symmetrically designed teeth on opposite ends of a trap is a far greater wonder to behold. It is logic.

It describes uranium thus: "For the elements that make our earth came from the fiery cores of ancient suns, billions of years ago. The simplest of all these elements is the hydrogen atom; it has a single proton in its nucleus and an electron that circles it like a planet. Within suns hydrogen atoms fuse together and are joined by two neutrons. The result is a completely new element, Helium, whose two protons attract a pair of circling electrons. Helium in turn becomes the next heaviest element, Lithium, as more particles join its nucleus. Thus one by one all the 92 elements were forged in stellar fire until the heaviest atom of all was, uranium, was created. Uranium, with a nucleus of 92 protons and nearly twice as many neutrons held together by stellar energy. Uranium, whose energy man has learned to liberate. When a neutron strikes a uranium nucleus, it is absorbed. Under the strain of the added particle, the nucleus grows unstable and splits in two with a burst of energy, releasing more neutrons. In a mass of uranium, the neutrons of one fission travel on to produce further fissions, liberating more and more energy in an intense chain reaction. This same energy will eventually light our cities, run our factories, and power our ships and planes but to harness it man must build atomic reactors."} assumed a significance rivaling that of oil. Alongside the rise in the price of uranium compared to the beginning of the Ukraine war, the competition among great powers to source uranium, to build atomic reactors or forbid non-aligned States or State actors from building atomic reactors, harnessing nuclear power, controlling liberated stellar energy or otherwise capitalizing on the physics of energy, intensified sharply.}

In Zaporizhzhia, "Russia has taken the settlement of Lobkove," WM wrote, "after the recent capture of Stepove and Mali Shcherbaky. A Ukrainian counterattack into Shcherbaky has prevented its capture so far. Southwest of Pokrovsk, Russia has attacked towards, and come within 3km of, the Dnipropetrovsk Oblast boundary. In Belgorod, Russian counterattacks have pushed Popovka and Demidovka back to contested settlements. Russia crossed the Oskil again, this time at Kamianka. They now control or contest seven settlements on the west side of the Oskil. The situation in Toretsk is more clarified since the last post on the city. Though widely contested, Russian forces retained a presence in areas throughout the city. These have since come back into their control, and some forces have now moved northwest of the city."

It is likely that elements of the security elite attacked WM for publishing truthful information about the course of the war, a major transgression for the pro-Ukrainian supporters of the U.S-led NATO alliance, since truthful information about the course of the war inevitably points towards a Ukrainian defeat.

The capstone of these operations in the southeastern Donbas is Vladimir Putin's declaration that Ukraine's continued resistance shall result in the fall of more villages like Pokrovsk. Putin's admonition is reflective of Russia's reality on the battlefield. The negativity of the battles in the Donbas reflect the reality that the average rate of advance over time coupled with Russia's refusal to draw Kyiv's capital under fire control with artillery undermine Russia's ability to capture the right bank of the Dnipro, the area of Ukraine Putin highlighted as Russian during an interview with Tucker Carlson on February 9th, 2023. It is clear that Russia can capture villages but a large scale offensive to capture the right bank of the Dnipro-at the time of his statement-cannot be justified any circumstance related to Russia's current standing in the war.

\entry{Woolbridge, Michael} {} {} {Michael Woolbridge is one of the founders of Artificial Intelligence who distinguishes himself from contemporaries like Eric Schmidt, an AI extremist, by his firm grasp on the limits of AI. Whereas many like Eric Schmidt attribute consciousness to machines, Schmidt does not. Schmidt, for instance, does not believe that the latest version of ChatGPT reasons. He believes that the responses ChatGPT produces are not a reflection of reason but pattern recognition. The ChatGPT machine is able to mimic the responses of the large body of data. \newline \indent The problem with Artificial Intelligence is not necessarily the data but the first principles upon which builders rely to create machines like ChatGPT. The widespread reliance on a binary number system is responsible for the limitations of its logic. The binary number system lends itself to a logic where the primary mode of evaluation is nothing but a single choice: either the unit or its negation. Logic like propositional logic is precisely the type of logic that relies on the same. In a situation where there is no middle term, the limited logic of the machine cannot progress syllogistically. In the absence of a syllogistic type of logic, the ability to move from a minor to a major premise does not happen. Hence the machine's first principles are responsible for its inability to reason. Succinctly put, ChatGPT cannot reason for lack of a middle term. \newline \indent A machine whose logic avoids Leibniz' binary number system logic can be based on James Clark Maxwell's understanding of colors. In Maxwell's systems, there are three primary colors, Red, Green, and Blue. In much the same way that the Chinese have utilized DNA to record information on cassette tapes\footnote{In an article under the title, "A compact cassette tape for DNA-based data storage," published on September 10th, 2025 in \emph{Science Advances}, a team of Chinese scientists, who are far more productive than Americans, produced the first ever DNA-based data storage on a number system unrelated to Leibniz' binary number system. Americans could never achieved such a thing because America's police state bureaucracy, of which the Socialist Equality Party is an essential component, seeks to undermine its own citizens by transforming political dissidents into targets the Federal government exploits for the sake of laundering hundreds of millions of dollars on "investigations." America's insistence on wastefulness is extremely advanced, since the Federal government's police state organizations such as the Socialist Equality Party have infiltrated American universities with the a fellow police state organization, the United Auto Workers union. The UAW fulfills the function of an Orwellian thought police on graduate students so that laboratories in Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence, or Information Technology never benefit from the talented appreciation free thinking graduate students are entitled to enjoy in a true democracy. The money that America must spend on agents from the UAW to police graduate students is wasted on non-productive surveillance.}, the three colors, whose unity is white, produce four terms. A fifth term may be the deprivation of the four. A Maxwellian type of color-based storage could easily meet or exceed the storage power of DNA, since marking for DNA consumes more space on a ribbon in a cassette than color. Color on film would easily store far more than DNA on a cassette's ribbon. Hence even in the area of data storage, which the repudiation of Leibniz' binary number system has already confirmed the extensibility of a non-binary system, Maxwell's color system may provide for greater computational power (being able not only to compute but to store information) than preceding types of computational systems.

\entry { X } {} {} {X, the platform formerly known as X, is where the vast majority of the information from secondary commentators, commenting on information from Telegram or directly from Russia's or Ukraine's frontlines, publish most or all commentaries. While institutes usually publish directly from the institute's website, the first priority is to advertise its publication on X. The news agencies, such as the \emph{New York Times}, the \emph{Guardian}, \emph{Financial Times}, \emph{Wall Street Journal}, \emph{Foreign Policy}, \emph{Foreign Affairs}, \emph{The Economist}, or other publications, advertise publications immediately through X. It is one of the greatest sources of information on the Ukraine war. Although primary sources publish almost exclusively in Telegram, X is second to none for discovering commentary. \newline \indent It is the only place on earth where journalists, open source investigators, commentators, or analysts can openly engage in debate without reprisals. While the ruling elite from one country to the next is unified in its ambitious pursuit of control over any or all thought, X allows much to escape the clutches of what Julian Assange calls the "security elite." \newline \indent There are signs that the "security elite" has targeted specific members of the X community for expressing points of view in contradiction with the security elite's requirements for the preservation of conformed thought on the platform but X did not play an active role.

\entry{Zaslon-M radar} {} {} {With the R-37M missile at their disposal, Russian MiG-31BMs equipped with the Zaslon-M radar have been able to fire at Ukrainian aircraft from very considerable distances,  since the beginning of the Ukraine war, without entering any of the areas in which the Ukrainian anti-aircraft defenses were operating. \newline \indent Nonetheless, the Zaslon-M radar, equipped on MiG-31BM interceptors, demonstrates how dependent the modern Russian war machine continues to be in its reliance upon the almost unrivaled treasure chest of discoveries, inventions or ideas the Soviet Union bequeathed its usurpers upon collapse.
