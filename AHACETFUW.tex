\entry{A-50} {} {} {Russia's A-50, none of which were in production before, during, or after the Ukraine war, represented one of the relics of the Soviet ingenuity the collapse of the U.S.S.R. left behind. During the Ukraine war, Russia lost several A-50s. On February 23rd, 2023, the day after the first anniversary of the Ukraine war, Belarusian opposition groups allegedly attacked a Russian A-50 near Minsk at a Belarusian Air Force base called the Machulishchy Air Base. The head of the Belarusian opposition group, BYPOL (i.e., Aliaksandr Azarov), claimed to have executed the attack with drones (i.e., \texthebrew{רחפנים}). BYPOL is alleged to have been one of the defectors from the Belarusian state security services during the protests that erupted against Alexander Lukashenko in 2020.\footnote{[\texthebrew{חוגי אופוזיציה בבלו רוסיה: תקפנו  ברחפנים וגרמנו נזק למטוס פיקוד וביון רוסי ברייב A-50 שחנה בבסיס אווירי ליד מינסק, תיק דבקה
}]}} 

\entry{ADHD} {} {} {ADHD or Attention Deficit Hyperactive Disorder, is one of the many different pseudo neuroses broke, bankrupt, bribe-hungry psychologists, who are a proponent of Fromm's love on Monday, Freud's egotistical aspiration for sex on Tuesday, or Jung's shadow chasing on Wednesday, concocted to ensure American pharmaceutical companies, who are making hundreds of millions from even more enhanced synthetic forms of 20th century drugs such as Xanax\footnote{America's popular culture has missed no opportunity to promote Xanax. In a feature for Travis Scott's song, Sicko Mode, Drake glorifies the drug when he compares himself to a light in a cliché, saying "I did half a Xan, thirteen hours 'til I land Had me out like a light." }, could earn a tremendous amount from the creation of a new generation of drug addicts, who might be capable of superseding their parents' generation of Methamphetamine addicts, whose lives the modern American police state bureaucracy have exploited for an untold number of Court cases, imprisonments, or ruined lives from the 1970s to the present. }

\entry{ad hominem} {} {} {In the vast majority of cases where members of the community express opinions different from those of certain groups, representing hypotheses on the outcomes, solutions, or remedies for Ukraine's ultimate failure on the battlefield, the groups respond \textenglish{\emph{ad hominem}}.\footnote{You can read more about 𝑎𝑑 ℎ𝑜𝑚𝑖𝑛𝑒𝑚 arguments in Aristotle's 𝑆𝑜𝑝ℎ𝑖𝑠𝑡𝑖𝑐𝑎𝑙 𝑅𝑒𝑓𝑢𝑡𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛𝑠, 178(b)17 where Aristotle describes the 𝑟𝑖𝑠𝑢𝑠 𝑠𝑜𝑝ℎ𝑖𝑠𝑡𝑖𝑐𝑢𝑠 in which 'persons direct their solutions against the man, not against his arguments.'} The groups attack the person but leave his or her arguments in tact. The most common theme for an attack \emph{ad hominem} is to claim man is the measure of all things\footnote{Protagoras, the pre-Socratic Greek philosopher (c.490–c.420 BC) espoused the view. He stated: "\textgreek{πάντων χρημάτων μέτρον ἐστὶν ἄνθρωπος, τῶν μὲν ὄντων ὡς ἔστιν, τῶν δὲ οὐκ ὄντων ὡς οὐκ ἔστιν}."} so that by a measure of expertise (however unqualified it may actually be) a man from the group is higher, stronger or smarter than the attacked. In the vast majority of these cases, the measure for height, strength or intelligence is hardly based upon anything one might associate with these concepts, especially in terms of analysis. The vast majority of the assailants can hardly muster a record on predictions commensurate with intelligence. \newline \indent The alleged prohibition on double negatives is a perfect example. An attack on a person's grammar is a great way to deflect attention away from the substance of a meritorious claim, transforming the substance of the counterargument into an ad hominem attack. But, alas, Americans who commit this error demonstrate not only their own personal dedication to a complete disregard of American history but a distinct ignorance for the causes of revolution. Benjamin Franklin, for instance, wrote about the causes of the Revolutionary War with double negatives. In fact, Franklin wrote: "That is simple. In the Colonies we issue our own money. It is called Colonial Scrip. We issue it in proper proportion to the demands of trade and industry to make the products pass easily from the producers to the consumers. In this manner, creating for ourselves our own paper money, we control its purchasing power, and we have no interest to pay to no one." \footnote{It would seem that Colonial Scrip is a far better store of value for colonial goods than the imposition of English monies in the form of silver or gold coins minted at the Royal Mint following the Crown's passage of the Currency Act in 1764. Who could ever imagine currency to have been at the heart of the colonial uprising? Given the U.S. no longer issues its own currency, Colonial Scrip demonstrates now how far the U.S. has come in monetary policy from its post-revolutionary achievements.} Double negatives are but among the many different devices in grammar sophists seize to deflect rather than to defend or attack an idea directly.} 


\entry{America's 250th Anniversary} {} {} {Almost entirely hallowed out, the United States of America celebrates its 250th anniversary after Ukraine's fourth anniversary. With 40 trillion dollars of Federal debt, the United States celebrated without a single mega project to signify the greatness of Thomas Jefferson's Declaration of Independence, the Federalist Papers, or the Constitution of the United States of America; in the past fifty years (i.e., from 1973 to the present), the United States has produced literally nothing for the State.\footnote{It is fascinating how the Former Commonwealth Countries have no problem finding a monument, statue or memorial from the Soviet Union ripe for destruction but the United States has hardly built a single monument, statue or memorial in the past fifty years, let alone for the great founding fathers of the republic.} Whereas in the distant past, the United States built or witness the building mega projects like the Empire State Building or the Hoover Dam, the United States has accomplished nothing in the way of magnificient infrastructure in the past fifty years.  \newline \indent The United States of America does not even have a Federal government. America's Federal government is just a vessel for the rich, private central banking, or members of the State security apparatus linked to one (i.e., the Federal government in AWS cloud), the other, or both, to extract capital from American working people in a multitudinous manner. While the complexity of the scheme is almost impenentrable, the 16th Amendment currently sanctions no less than seventy five cents for every American dollar income tax to the Federal government to pay the interests on its Federal debt.
} 

It is incomprehensible how so many people can simply stand by while our County's workers' surplus value is simply hauled off daily at an alarming rate, while more than 75 cents per dollar of income tax pays interests to banks who loan money to the Federal government that the U.S. Treasury prints. Ridiculous in the extreme, the entire system is built on an expansion of usury. In the past fifty years (i.e., from the present to 1973), the United States has produced literally nothing. You would think that after 39 trillion dollars the U.S. would have impressive mega projects on display for the 250th anniversary. There is not a single mega project the U.S. can celebrate for the 250th anniversary. 

}

\entry{anniversary} {} {} {An act of humanization is to commemorate the recurence of a great historical event with celebration. The progression in history from agriculture, for instance, reflects this humanization in its progression towards historical events. In the Old Testament the Israelites transformed the important agricultural feasts into commemorations. The Passover, originally a spring festival for harvest, became a celebration for the exodus from Egypt; the Feast of Weeks, an old harvest festival at the end of the wheat harvet (Exodus 23:16; 34:22) became \emph{סמחת תורה}. The feast of booths, an old vinters festival, became the holiday of \texthebrew{סוכות} (Leviticus 23:42f). Heschel explains how "the unique events of historic time were spiritually more significant than the repetitive processes in the cycle of nature, even though physical sustenance depended on the latter." (Heschel, 1951; "Prologue," \emph{The Sabbath}) Holidays are anniversaries. 
}


\entry{Annenberg Foundation} {} {} {The Annenberg Foundation, one of the most important sources of free-market philanthropy in the history of the United States for education, contributed significantly to the development of objective consciousness among the American masses with the release of the first precursor to the development of Massive Open Online Courses during the 1980s. In its publications, some of which are among the absolute best in terms of pedagogy, content or intellectual challenge, Annenberg inspired Americans to study Spanish, French, Physics, or the history of the West, broadcasting America's finest professors from the best universities in the world right into American living rooms on Public Broadcasting Companies' channels. In its release of \emph{Destinos}, the Annenberg Foundation, provided Americans with the opportunity to study Spanish for free in 58 lessons; detailing the revelation a survivor of the Spanish Civil War, the war the Soviets and the Russians utilized to experiment with doctrine and weapons, discloses to his family about a forsaken bride, \emph{Destinos} takes viewers from basic to intermediate Spanish. The legendary \emph{French in Action} features the Capretz Method for learning language the creator of the course, Pierre Capretz, developed in his accompanying textbooks for the course. A 52 episode television series that combines language instruction with cultural immersion into a French family in Paris, France, Capretz produced the series at both Yale University and Wellesley College, the latter still being a leader in the pedagogy of foreign languages with its three part Italian course on \emph{edX}\footnote{}. Still widely used since 1987, \emph{French in Action} is a classic for foreign language learning in America during the 1980s. Funded entirely by the Annenberg Foundation, \emph{French in Action} provided Americans, tired, overwhelmed with debt, laboring under glass cielings in industries whose unions long ago sold their souls to the Federal Bureau of Investigation for large salaries, a way not only to view an almost unreachable world abroad but adopt to the speaking lifestyle of its characters from the comfort of home. In its lecture series from the University of California, Los Angeles, the Annenberg Foundation provided Americans with a glimpse into the delicacies of the Western Tradition over more than 3000 years of history. \newline \indent The most famous of all projects the Annenberg Foundation released is a series of lectures by a professor named Goldstein at California Polytechnic State University, San Luis Obispo entitled \emph{The Mechanical Universe}. In much the same way as Capretz own textbook for \emph{French in Action} is a classic for language learners, Goldstein's own textbook, \emph{The Mechanical Universe and Beyond}, is itself a classic. In the history of pedagogy for physics there is perhaps no better textbook than Goldstein's own. \newline \indent Goldstein's lectures, which provided Americans with access to the history of science in terms of its development over time from the Ancient Greek discoveries in geometry through the Renaissance developments in the destruction of the Aristotelian universe to the emergence of the major contributors to theoretical physics such as James Clark Maxwell or Albert Einstein, are one of the most valuable for developing objective consciousness among the American masses. The Catholic Church, depicted in the video with revealing light, takes Galileo, the founder of law of inertia, to Court for his views on the relation of the sun to the earth in the revolutions of the heavenly spheres. Descartes, whose metaphysics, the \emph{Meditations}, launched a major revision of the theoretical basis for being, unveils his geometric interpretation of algebra. Leibniz and Newton and their famous dispute over priority for the calculus play out across multiple episodes. Benjamin Franklin, whose mathematics the author appraises without a single doubt, receives credit for his discover of positively or negatively charged electricity.  While the series hardly touches upon the subjects many of the figures from the Enlightenment raised in famous treatises, the series establishes a mechanistic point of view about the universe in a way no competing, contemporary, or pre-existing popular television series could have at the time. No MOOC has ever come to rival Goldstein's \emph{The Mechanical Universe}. It is an all around classic. \newline \indent Sadly, the Annenberg Foundation's series are no longer televised on American television channels primarily due to the fact that there are no longer channels. Its era of television is no longer existent. While the series themselves advertise purchase video cassette, the most frequently visited sites on the Internet for torrents provide downloads with a large number of seeders.

\entry{Ardent, Hannah} {} {} {Hannah Ardent's book, \emph{The Origins of Totalitarianism}, is one of the primary sources of inversion the Central Intelligence Agency exploits for transformation into a modern American playbook for engaging in the mass manipulation of America's public opinion. The definition of authoritarianism in Ardent's book is inverted so that rather than being points of descriptions scholars might like to employ as an instrument for identifying authoritarianism, these points suddenly become elements in a cause of action illegally deployed domestic agents must implement to ensure the agency's controlled control over American public opinion. } 

\entry{Artemis II} {} {} {Less than eight months after Elon Musk released a documentary detailing \emph{The Road to Making Life Multiplanetary} for SpaceX to inhabit Mars on May 29th, 2025 with an uncrewed launch at the end of 2026, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) announced the first crewed lunar spaceflight by the United States since Apollo 17 in 1972 with the earliest launch date scheduled for February 6th, 2026, only a few weeks before the fourth anniversary of the Ukraine war. Four astronauts are scheduled to fly around the Moon on Artemis II for establishing a long-term presence on the planet for exploration. Expected to last 10 days, the flight focuses on confirming which systems or hardware are needed for early human lunar exploration missions. Building on the success of the uncrewed Artemis I in 2022, Artemis II is a major deep space mission for American aeronautics.}


\entry{Artemovsk} {Donbas} {village} {See \textbf{Bakhmut-Artemovsk}.}

\entry{Artillery} {weapon} { } {In a phrase coined by the gravedigger of the revolution,\footnote{In his profound study of the social origins of the Soviet Union after Stalin's rise to power, \emph{The Revolution Betrayed}, Trotsky explained how without a worker revolution based on the theory of permanent revolution but aiming to reintroduce Lenin's democratic centralism into the Communist Party, the degenerated Soviet worker's state would inevitably collapse from stagnation. Stalin's decision to impose Socialism in One Country on the Communist Party together with a series of bloody reprisals designed to effectuate a political genocide against the generation of Octoberist workers confirmed Trotsky's analysis when the Soviet Union, suffering from years of Stalin's policies, disintegrated on 26 December 1991 by Declaration No. 142-N, a declaration the Soviet of the Republics of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union made to dissolve the federation.} Joseph Stalin, artillery is the god of war. The god of war, however, is now but only a vital component in an evolving array of combined arms in eastern Europe. In the beginning of the Ukraine war the  media focused almost exclusively on parity. The number of Russian artillery guns, calibre, the number of munitions, the type of munitions, or the way in which the Russians accurately targeted Ukrainian targets demonstrated the advantage Russia weaned over its opponent. ّIn nearly every category, the Russians managed to demonstrate a noticeable superiority, a superiority not merely in quantity but in quality. The range of Russian calibres for artillery, for instance, far exceeded that of the Ukrainians. Confined to the 155mm M777 howitzers, the Ukrainians could not exercise fire control over battle areas in the way the Russians did. \newline \indent In the beginning of the Ukraine war, primarily before the great Ukrainian offensive in Kharkiv, launched on September 6th but largely until the end of Ukraine's 'Spring' counteroffensive in 2023, artillery played a dominant role on the battlefield. Ukraine's failed 'Spring' counteroffensive confirmed Russia's seizure of the strategic initiative after the fall of Bakhmut-Artemovsk on May 23rd, 2023. In the winter of 2023 the Ukraine war underwent a major transformation in the deployment of drones. Ukraine began to mass produce First Person View (FPV) drones to strengthen its defense of the Donbas in the face of continued Russian advances. Necessity is the mother of invention but the transformation could have come soon enough for Ukraine's defense of Avdiivka, a major turning point in the Ukraine war after the fall of Bakhmut-Artemovsk for Russian tactics (i.e., tunneling and FAB bombing with ”glide kits”) and Ukraine's deficiencies in artillery. Ukraine's FPV drones began to play a dominant role on the battlefield, overtaking but by no means substituting for the role artillery played in the beginning of the war. The first Ukrainian brigades with dedicated, trained, expert drone pilots began to take shape.}

\entry{Asimov, Isaac} {} {} {Isaac Asimov, undoubtedly one of the great geniuses of America, produced an encyclopedia called \emph{Asimov's Biographical Encyclopedia of Science and Technology} with no fewer than 1,510 entires. Covering the lives of more than 1000 great scientists from ancient Greece to the Space Age, Asimov's work celebrated its 60th anniversary during the second anniversary of the Ukraine war. Asimov's organization is not alphabetic but chronological. \newline \indent Asimov omissions, however, are hardly palatable. In his description of Anaxagoras, Asimov omits any mention of the fact that Anaxagoras opposed the pre-Socratic materialists with his emphasis on the Ancient Greek word for mind, \textgreek{νοῦς}. While certainly the modern concept of consciousness is far closer to the Ancient Greek word for soul, Anaxagoras' opposition to the pre-Socratic marked a distinct break from the elemental theories such as earth, wind, fire, or water theories pre-Socratic philosophers like Heraclitus or Thales prophesied. Asimov omits Aristotle's discussion of these elemental theories in his treatment of being in the notes commonly called \emph{The Metaphysics}.}


\entry{Aquinas, Thomas} {} {} {On March 7th, 2024, just after the second anniversary of the Ukraine war, Thomas Aquinas, a graduate from one of France's first universities, an intellectual giant who built a bridge from antiquity through the Dark Ages to the pre-Renaissance, celebrated his 750 anniversary. St. Thomas Aquinas is famous for his repudiation of usury in his magnum opus, the \emph{Summma Theologia}.\footnote{During the third anniversary of the Ukraine war, the University of St. Thomas, Saint John Paul II Institute, began to offer a master's degree in the thought of John Paul II. With its first classes starting on January 12th, 2026, the program offers students the opportunity to develop an appreciation for St. Thomas Acquinas' repudiation of usury firsthand through the study Saint John Paul II on top of all 14 encyclicals with the opportunity to conduct research, a pilgrimage, and to study abroad in Poland, the country fast becoming the latest economic powerhouse of Europe. The classes are asynchronous so that working adults can accommodate their schedules. It is unclear whether the program offers the opportunity to complete a thesis but students who enroll in the program ought to demand as a prerequisite for payment of tuition the right to have a dissertation completed.}}

% Aquinas is a most seditious philosopher for the United States; his belief in the promulgation of the law is contrary to the U.S.'s decision to subvert the logic of its decisions from what is principally sound into asinine contortions pulled from thin air; his belief in a correspondence theory of truth derived from Aristotle's understanding of speech is exceptionally subversive in an environment where lies, deceit, or falsehood are constantly peddled as a matter of course to the masses in propaganda reel after reel. The Western media therefore covered only very little about Aquinas, seeking to ensure that his revolutionary doctrines on law or truth remain submerged in the hundreds of unbound pages his unread books conceal to the unconscious. 

\entry{Avdiivka} {Donbas} {village} {Ukraine's defense of Avdiivka, a major turning point in the Ukraine war after the fall of Bakhmut-Artemovsk for Russian tactics (i.e., tunneling and FAB bombing with ”glide kits”) and Ukraine's deficiencies in artillery and its deployment of FPV drones, collapsed on January 17th, 2024.}

\entry{Axe, David} {} {} {One of the more committed journalists of the Ukraine war, whose coverage of the Donbas, especially in the Avdiivka direction\footnote{One of the most important contributions to understanding the Ukraine's defeat in the Avdiivka direction is the 47th Mechanized Brigade in 2024. A prominent unit in the Ukrainian military, heavily involved in fighting Russian forces in the Avdiivka direction, particularly with Western-supplied equipment like M-1 Abrams tanks and M-2 Bradley fighting vehicles, the 47th Brigade perished within less than six months from its reconstitution. Deployed to Pavlohrad, 60 miles west of Pokrovsk, the front line in eastern Ukraine’s Donetsk Oblast, fought desperately with the 31 M-1 Abrams tanks to stop Russian advances. Consequently, the 47th Brigade lost more than half of its company of 31 M-1 Abrams tanks to Russian attacks. While the attacks claiming these tanks vary, the vast majority of the attacks stem from Russian FPV drones. The perished 47th Mechanized Brigade demonstrated that Western military equipment, though not obsolete by any means, was, nonetheless, no match for Russia on the battlefield in the Avdiivka direction. The destruction of the first M-1 Abrams tank, long considered to be the world's best tank, shattered the illusion of the overwhelming invincibility of American firepower. Not only were the tanks underwhelming, they were distinctively vulnerable.} from 2023 to the present, eclipsed others. Published primarily in \emph{Forbes}, these articles are an important source of information. At a time when the majority of news from the frontlines comes almost exclusively from 'milbloggers,' Axe's analyses shed light on rarely mentioned or hardly examined aspects of the Ukraine war. These aspects, though without the extensive detail of a comprehensive study, allow readers to imagine the whole of the subconscious iceberg from a partial view of its conscious tip. \newline \indent \emph{Forbes}, however, is a publication with a purpose. Its annual lists of America's four hundred richest Americans shows how its purpose, however, may converge with another. These lists, for instance, constituted one of the Socialist Equality Party's primary staples of propaganda in the years preceding the 2008 subprime mortgage crisis, the decade after the party's launch of the World Socialist Website in 1998\footnote{The SEP's launch preceded the Federal Bureau of Investigation's launch of a Federal Intrusion Detection Network, or FIDNET, modeled after a famous program from Linux's suite of open source security software called Snort, a network intrusion detection system (NIDS). Mentioned in the article published on  August 10th, 1999, under the title "White House plan for FBI Internet spying," FIDNET is one of the earliest precursors to the drag-net surveillance Edward Snowden exposed in his leak of secret documents from the National Security Agency (NSA). Originally exposed in an article published on July 28th, 1999, by the \emph{New York Times} under the title, "The U.S. Drawing Plan That Will Monitor Computer Systems," FIDNET is a part of the pre-history to the U.S. conspiracy to deprive citizens of life, liberty, or the pursuit of happiness through the technological obliteration of the founding father's Bill of Rights, especially the Fourth Amendment. Although the early SEP article makes no mention of the U.S. Constitution, the legal critique, so famous now, would only become more provocative as the U.S. conspiracy strengthened its execution.} under the pretense of a Marxian renaissance.\footnote{In an article published on October 31st, 1998 under the title, "International school examines the century’s central problems of history, politics and culture," the International Committee of the Fourth International emphasized how a "central premise guiding the school was that a renaissance of Marxism is fundamental to the development of a perspective that can answer the burning issues of the day—growing social inequality, deepening economic crises, the decline in the cultural level of society and the prevailing political paralysis of the workers movement."} The SEP's early articles\footnote{The first appears to be ["Gap between rich and poor is wider than ever," June 23, 1998] but many more follow: ["The Forbes 200 list: billions for the privileged few," June 30, 1999], ["Forbes 400 list of richest Americans: snapshot of a financial oligarchy," September 24th, 2004], ["Forbes reports bonanza for world’s billionaires," May 9th, 2005], ["The very rich in America: “The kind of money you cannot comprehend," April 19, 2006], ["Forbes publishes list of 400 richest Americans," October 6, 2006], ["The filthy rich: Forbes lists America’s top 400 for 2007," November 27th, 2007], ["America’s “Fortunate 400” control vast wealth," March 7th, 2008].} demonstrate this convergence. Opposed to the decade of doldrums, history's acceleration, however, has required expanded coverage of more fundamental political issues such as the Ukraine war. \newline \indent Axe's ability to achieve T.S. Eliot's ideal for the portrayal of an event, however tainted by his ambition for a Ukrainian victory, in his reporting on the war could not but be a source of concern for a magazine dedicated to celebrating the richest 400 Americans annually. The inversion of the invisible but highly detailed iceberg from the visible but only slightly detailed tip in his writing provided readers with far more with which to imagine the truth than receive a programmed vision of propaganda. It is simply unacceptable. It is pure blasphemy! It would thus only be a matter of time before \emph{Forbes}, whose aim is to articulate the interests of this wealthy elite, would clash with Axe's reporting on the Ukraine war, a war politicized to the extreme. At the end of the day, \emph{Forbes}, famous for its annual celebrations of the country's top one percent, decided to fire Axe, terminating his coverage before the end of the Ukraine war, the outcome of which has been to deprive not only the present but posterity of one its auspicious eyes.

By standing with one foot on Baudrillard's and Zizek's neck, the triumphant "pure" Marxist fanatics cannot only claim victory but trumpet the preservation of orthodoxy. This is precisely what members of the Socialist Equality Party during the \emph{Anschluss} period (i.e., 1998 to 2008). It is so-called the \emph{Anschluss} period for the Socialist Equality Party, the Federal government's social-chauvinist plaything for orchestration, exploited these individuals for a "Greater Marxism" in a propaganda campaign the likes of which only Joeseph Goebbels would have had the pettiness to denounced for Bolshevism! The \emph{Anschluss} represented or corresponded, however, with one of the great contributions to the theoretical understanding of Marxism, despite the fact that the orchestrators of the debate, committed social-chauvinist, only masqueraded as revolutionaries under the banner of Trotskyism. Just as Engels wrote that history would have found a "world spirit" in someone else for the lack of Napoleon, history furnished out of these exceptionally corrupted individuals a purity for the theory of Marxism true Marxists can only marvel. The debate against Steiner and Brenner, perhaps the greatest intellectual orchestration of the 21st century, represented the contents of the \emph{Anschluss} for Marxists. While the project ultimately failed by design, pure Marxists may, nonetheless, destroy their contribution in a characteristically Hegelian manner for the future of Lenin, Trotsky, Velt'man, or Deborin. While the activity of Marxism, the debate may claim, is thoroughly contained to paper, the paper lives.\footnote{The Russians have a phrase to describe the process with an Alexandrian flare. \textrussian{Рукопись не горит}.}

% One of the tools in orchestration which the members of the Socialist Equality Party have adopted is Debord's so-called \emph{détournement}, "which involves using spectacular images and language to disrupt the flow of the spectacle." A most recent deployment of Debord's so-called \emph{détournement} is the SEP's decision to exploit the orchestrated, or, if he really did die, real death of Alex Pretti "to disrupt the flow of the spectacle" on ICE in Minneapolis, Minnesota, shifting the social outrage away from the overthrow of the American capitalist system to the abolition of ICE by means of a "general strike." The disruption to the flow of the ICE spectacle thus assumed the character of mass movements with mass movements staged throughout major cities over the course of a week with sophisticated social engineering tools on social media, politically debased psuedo-left parties like the Democratic Socialists of America, the Socialist Equality Party (where the elite orchestrators occupy highranking titled positions with publications under name or nom de plume), or Party for Socialism and Liberation, and Hollywood trained actors, grey ghost agent saboteurs, or aesthetically pleasing leaders like Abby Martin\footnote{}. Alex Pretti's Debord's so-called \emph{détournement} thus transformed the content of the orchestration from random acts of reaction into a social movement under the Federal government's control or within the tentacles of the great octopus of Federated, centralized, technologically advanced agencies whose self-expressed aim is to suppress the Bill of Rights in their entirety.

Spelt \textukrainian{Бахмут — Артемівськ} in Ukrainian but —  \textrussian{Бахмут — Артемовск} in Russian, the city's history is unique. \newline \indent During the Nazi retreat in the aftermath of Operation Barbarossa's failure in 1943, Manstein, the 1st conquerer of Sevastopol, an expert in warfare against the Soviets, the Field Marshall whose counterstroke against the Soviets at Orel created the Kursk salient, organized Bakhmut-Artemovsk together Slavyansk and Kramatorsk into the Nazi lynchpin of defense for the Donbas. It is alleged that the Nazis withdrew before the Soviets managed to lay siege to the city, indicating that the Nazis never lost but forfeit the city. The fall of Bakhmut-Artemovsk therefore contained immense political, historical, military significance for the Russians. Ukraine's inability to stand the village up against the Russians terminated its ability to cling to the mythological power of its stand against the Soviets during the 1943 Nazi retreat, severing the early Ukrainian Galician narrative from Ukraine's armed forces. The Russians sacked the stronghold at Bakhmut-Artemovsk, preventing the Ukrainians from being able to revive the myth of Manstein's defense. The Ukrainian affinity for Nazism, renaming its streets after members of the Galician SS,\footname{Nazi generals considered the Galician SS to be an militarily inferior unit in the Nazi \emph{Wehrmacht}, denigrating its ability to conduct maneuvers, defend, or fight on the Eastern front.} stopped, dying silently without much of a trace in the media.

\entry{Barabbas} {} {} {A magnificent man, a man of many talents, fond of alcohol, games, the harem, Barabbas is alleged to have been a Jewish bandit who encouraged large crowds to raise up against the Roman occupiers of Jerusalem, the center of the earth. Pardoned at the Passover feast by the  eloquent, gracious, magnanimous Roman governor, Pontius Pilate, an executioner who deferred judgement on Jesus' death to the crowd that chose Barabbas,\footnote{John 18:39-40} Barabbas narrowly escaped death. Is Barabbas, a rhetorician, so awe-inspiring as to have compelled a crowd to select him over an ostracized, though marginally influential, prophet from  Nazareth or were the crowds so cognizant of Pilate's dilemma as to have preferred a direct challenger to Rome's reign over the city than the hypothetical promise of its theological subversion through a universalization of Judaism from a man who rode into the city of Jerusalem on a donkey? Setting aside these two men, whose natures are equally obscure and inexplicable, what of the crowd? What is the significance of the crowd's choice? Did the crowd make a cognizant choice? If the crowd made a cognizant choice, why has so much history been dedicated to Jesus of Nazareth, whereas men like Barabbas, who embodied the spirit of defiance, the force of resistance, the soul of revolution, have been marginalized to the back pages of obscure variations in Biblical texts? Should not the world over celebrate the day Pilate pardoned Barabbas\footnote{Isn't Pilate's pardon an atonement? No longer subject to the death penalty, Barabbas became subject to himself. Is that not an atonement? "For the life of the flesh is in the blood." Leviticus 17:11 Certainly, Barabbas' blood continued to circulate throughout his flesh after Pilate's pardon.} as a great holiday for mankind? Is not the history of mankind the history of crowd struggle? The crowd struggled. The crowd chose. The crowd chose Barabbas but Barabbas pales now in comparison to the fame, legend, or mythology of Jesus. As opposed to Jesus, the day of the Passover feast in the year of Jesus' death is not the beginning of a new era! What treachery! The date in the Western tradition for the beginning of the new era should not be "A.D." but "A.P." It should start with the Passover feast when Pilate, whose address to the crowd emphasized his eloquence, whose deference to the crowd's judgement magnified his grace, whose pardon symbolized his magnanimity for all of mankind, decided to acquiesce to the crowd. Does Pilate's acquiescence not underscore how all of history is but the reaction to the actions a crowd takes? How could the entire history of mankind not been written for Barabbas, who gambled, who drank, who fornicated, the man whose humanity more resembles his fellow man than Jesus, who overturned tables of money at the temple (i.e., Matthew 21:12-13; Mark 11:15-18), who did not drink anything but water\footnote{It is alleged, however, that Jesus was a drunkard because he drank wine. It is unclear to what extent he drank wine but there are apparently no passages from the haystack of variations in the disorganized, lost, historically unverified Biblical texts indicating he slurred his words, blacked out, or engaged in drunken brawls, all activities commonplace to drunkards at the time of the great Roman republic.}, who did not ravage but loved the adulteress and the prostitute and supervised a whore's atonement.\footnote{How could Jesus have not liked prostitutes after the way the one from Luke 7:38 treated him. She comes up behind him unannounced. She drops down into position on her knees. She sobs uncontrollably, soaking his feet. She cleaned his feet with her hair. She kissed his feet all over. Did she lick his toes or heel? She poured perfume on his feet after she spread her lips all over them. Who would not like a prostitute like the one from Luke 7:38? What man would not like the whore from Luke 7:38? \newline \indent In fact, Jesus appears to have equated the prospect for a prostitute's love to the height of her prices. Jesus' dialogue with Simon reads like a remarkably suggestive and provocative parable. After Jesus explains how a rich man cancelled debts for two men, one indebted to the tune of 50 silver pieces, the other 500, Simon asks him: Of the two forgiven men who do you suppose loved the borrower more? Simon says, "I suppose the one with the bigger debt." Jesus confirms his response. Luke 7:41-44 The confirmation, however, seems to suggest that the more a prostitute charges, the more she will love, since a person with the largest indebtedness is the one with the greatest love for the forgiving borrower. After all the difference in the constant between the debtors in the parable is nothing more than the amount of silver. The more silver, the more love. The less silver, the less love. The more debaucherous a prostitute solicits herself, the more forgiveness she may receive from Jesus. The more forgiveness she receives from Jesus, the most costly love she can offer back to him.} Why did humanity choose to follow the un-pardoned, executed rather than the pardoned, living man? How could history have been so unfair to Barabbas? What of the crowds of mankind that chose to follow Jesus rather than Barabbas after Jesus' death? What of the crowds of man that chose to follow Barabbas rather than Jesus after Barabbas lived? What liveliness inspired the crowds following Barabbas to emulate his image?\footnote{The pardon is the first step in the history of the revolution. In the age of Dostoyevsky, the so-called \emph{\textrussian{Петрашевцы}} in 1849 survived a firing squad only to carry the light of Karl Marx forward until eventually Lev Davidovich Bronstein, a contemporary Barabbas the Russian proletariat selected twice to lead a revolution against the Caesar of Russia, received a kind of pardon in 1905 with the exile he successfully evaded.}} 

% \newline \indent Although the origins of Barabbas may be obscure, Barabbas name is a source of immense obscurity. The number of variations abounds across the different languages, almost to a point where the only thing one can say for certain about his name is its similarity to Jesus.

\entry{Secretary Bessent's at the Mad Hatter's tea party} {} {} {Secretary Bessent's time at the "Mad Hatter's Tea Party" on February 5th, 2026 played host to a conversation that became a quintessential example of a discussion where various topics are explored at length without a clear purpose, meandering through various topics with a clear objective, emphasizing the whimsical charm of Wonderland, as in Mad Hatter's tea party, in \emph{Alice's Adventures in Wonderland}. Despite his appointment to be the Secretary of the Treasury, Congress asked questions about Immigration Customs and Enforcement (ICE) whose jurisdiction is under the authority of Kristi Noem's Department of Homeland Security, questions about Vladimir Putin's criminality whose purview is under the auspices of Marc Rubio's Department of State, about the printing presses in the U.S. Federal Reserve, to which Bessent exclaimed he cannot print "magic money" like the Robert Powell. Bessent discussed Donald Trump’s frivolous 10 billion lawsuit against the IRS over his leaked tax returns, where the settlement would be paid entirely by U.S. taxpayers, if he were to win or the IRS settle.\footnote{A hoax, the "leaked" tax returns were never leaked; the Federal government is so centralized that information about anyone related to its functioning is available on hand.} Bessent discussed Iran where he claimed "[we] created a dollar shortage in the country." He continued, saying "It came to a swift conclusion. I would say the culmination came in December, when one of the largest banks in Iran went under after a bank run. The central bank had to print money."\footnote{The claim that Bessent's "dollar shortage" caused Iran's protests is heavily contested. Bloggers, for instance, claim a woman from a graduate school in Iran stripped to her underweath in protest of the country's draconian laws on personal choices for clothing.} \newline \indentDuring the conversation, Bessent defended tariffs claiming "they are not inflationary," citing an exhaustive historical study on subject by the San Francisco Fed.\footnote{The study published by the San Francisco Fed on November 13th, 2025 is entitled, "What Is a Tariff Shock? Insights from 150 years of Tariff Policy." The study claims "a tariff hike raises unemployment (lowers economic activity) and lowers inflation." The study confirms what Bessent says but the problem in the U.S. economy for not inflation is unrelated to the requirement for lowered economic activity, since high economic activity does not cause inflation. The curse, however, is worse than the disease. Inflation results from a number of factors related to the yield curve on bonds. Since the U.S. Federal debt rises by 1 trillion dollars every 80 days now, the yield curves on U.S. Treasury bonds have to rise to offset increased risk; yield curves rise with inflation. Despite shocks by tariffs, the US yield curves continue to steepen, with 2s-10s now trading at 73 bps; its widest level since early 2022. The lowered economic activity is double edge sword; the less active Americans become, the less income tax money they generate; since more than 75 of the Federal debt is paid by American income tax, lowered economic activity will exacerbate risk for the Federal debt. The following companies, for instance, have laid off workers in just the last year alone: ・Dell: 13,000, Intel: 27,000, Meta: 11,000, UPS: 48,000, FedEX: 12,000, Boeing: 17,000, Verizon: 15,000, Walmart: 12,000, Amazon: 30,000, Microsoft: 15,000, Citigroup: 20,000. These figure indicate just how lowered economic activity has become. The idea that a weaker dollar from tariff shocks may flip the 1.2 trillion dollar trade deficit to cash flow positivity is based on a remarkably unfounded assumption about macroeconomic history. No country in the history mankind has ever flipped trade from a deficit to a surplus in the amount of 1.2 trillion dollars.}Bessent could hardly contain from laughing. He almost broke face multiple times. The conversation, which spanned several hours, included many off the wall topics, subjects, or points Congress wanted to discuss that had almost nothing to do with the Secretary of the Treasury's office. Apart from the allusions to Twilight Zone, Never Never Land, or the Wizard of Oz, Washington is starting to play out from years of repeated theatrics. The show must go on!

\entry{de' Pitati, Bonifacio} {} {} {Bonifacio de' Pitati, called Bonifacio Veronese (Verona 1487-1553 Venice), celebrated his death's 470th anniversary on the first anniversary of the Ukraine war. A Venetian Renaissance painter who was active in the Venetian Republic, Bonifacio's work had an important influence on the younger generation of painters in Venice, especially his work depicting a violent Christ. In a monumental painting recognized by Peter Humfrey and Philip Cottrell as an important work, Bonifacio depicts the dramatic moment when Christ, having come to the Temple Mount in Jerusalem, began to assault the money changers, the only time in the entire New Testament where Christ becomes unmistakably violent. \newline \indent In keeping with the account in the Gospel of John (2:13-17), Bonifacio depicts Jesus with a whip formed of cords almost like that of a Roman legionnaire's baldric or cingulum militare, ready to strike one of the offenders, who crouches in fear. Crouched above an overturned table, he has raised his hand in defiance. He has a somber, agitated, guiltless look on his face. With one hand still on his table, he guards the scattered money (which is not depicted here) in an obvious display of defiance against Christ's authority. Overweight, pale as though the blood fell from his face, balding, the defiant money changer looks unmistakably sick, likely from his daily delight with the sinful practice of usury. Caged doves coo in front of Jesus' feet, signifying how the agents of peace, mercy or grace have yet to be unleashed. A shepard drives oxen and sheep. The windows in the background are a dull, poor, almost cliche reflection of a white, rocky Jerusalem, showing nothing more than undistinguished, distant mountains below haplessly cloudy skies, almost as though to draw the viewer away from the heavens beyond or above to the scene inside of the Temple Mount. \newline \indent Behind Christ stands a great menorah, higher than everyone and everything else at the very center of the painting, blazing with the reflection of a burnt offering right in front of a Cohen Jew, whose head is higher than all others, performing the ritual sacrifice bare foot with his head properly wrapped in correspondence with the laws, signifying the propensity among Ventians to elevate Judaism above Christianity in subtle, if not entirely prominent, ways. Bonifacio's depiction of the Cohen is thus curious. His attention to detail belies a surprising and unmistakably Jewish familiarity with the rite. In an interior inspired by the Church of San Salvador in Venice, a fully functional Temple Mount\footnote{By the time the House passed the State Department's bill with 3.3 billion dollars in aid for Israel on January 16th, 2026, the US had already given Israel 352 billion in aid since its founding but not a single one of these dollars ever went to rebuilding the Temple Mount. Can you imagine? 352 billion without a single ritual sacrifice on the Temple Mount? While Muslims are permitted to exercise the full range of their religions ((i.e., Shahada (the declaration of faith), Salah (prayer), Zakat (charity), Sawm (fasting during Ramadan), and Hajj (pilgrimage to Mecca)), Jews are not permitted to execute the full range of the mitzvot, especially those relating to the Temple Mount.} with a red burnt offering in the fire thus offers the backdrop for Jesus Christ to unleash his violence at the money-changer's bloodless usury.

\entry{Bryan, Julien} {} {} {In response to the revivification of Trump's so-called hemispheric defense during the Ukraine war, an attempt to recall the power America wielded over Latin America from 1898 to 1991, has brought to the surface of America's buried, 8-mm, 16-mm, or 32-mm history the films of Julien Bryan, who produced twenty three complete documentaries on South America,\footnote{Scholars tend to utilize multiple different types of categories to group Bryan's films. Chronologically, his films on South America are as follows: 1) 1941: \emph{Americans All}; 2) 1942: \emph{Argentine Primer}, \emph{Colombia: Crossroads of the Americas}, \emph{Venezuela Moves Ahead}, \emph{Roads South}, \emph{Schools to the South}, \emph{Children of the Americas}; 3) 1943: \emph{Atacama Desert}, \emph{Housing in Chile}, \emph{Good Neighbor Family}, \emph{Montevideo Family}, \emph{Young Uruguay}, \emph{Central Chile}, \emph{High Plain}, \emph{La Paz}; 4) 1944: \emph{Lima}, \emph{Lima Family}, \emph{Bolivia}; 5) 1945: \emph{Fundo in Chile}, \emph{Paraguay}, \emph{Peru}, \emph{South Chile}, \emph{Uruguay}. There are other groupings, however; these other groupings are not chronological but based on the film's subject matter.} four on Latin America as a region; five on Chile, three each about Peru, Bolivia, and Uruguay; and one each concerning Argentina, Columbia, Venezuela, and Paraguay. Although produced under the auspices of the Office of the Coordinator of Inter-American Affairs to foster hemispheric solidarity, Bryan's documentaries are a far cry from what might be reduced exclusively to the role of propaganda. Bryan's videos provide a unique glimpse of Latin America\footnote{Bryan's documentaries on the Middle East are equally valuable. In many of his documentaries on the Middle East, Bryan never fails to make mention of Christians, whose current role in the modern Middle East is far removed from the one contemporary Arab or Arabic news media envision.} in the post World War II era of unrivaled American superpower that ended sometime before the launch of Russia's full-scale invasion of the Ukraine. \newline \indent Although his analysis lacks the fire, resolve, or directionality of a communistic critique, Bryan's view of the regions of the world is a developing view of burgeoning classes of regional people. You can see these class descriptions in both his Latin American and his Middle Eastern documentaries. \newline \indent In his depictions of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, Bryan portrayed a view of Russian life few contemporary filmmakers ever achieved. Bryan characterizes the vast, fundamental, life-changing progress the Soviet Union achieved for Russians quickly with a list of hallmarks, the chief of which is leisure.\footnote{["Leisure Time : U.S.S.R.," \emph{International Film Foundation}. 1968]} Of leisure Bryan notes how the appetite for reading now is so keen for reading material that "often entire editions sell out overnight," whereas under the Czar "as much as 75 percent of Russians" could hardly read a letter, let alone write their own names.  In the Soviet Union there is a palace for pop culture; admission is free. The Russians, Bryan observes, call vacation on the Black Sea a "sanatorium." On vacation, Russians find "unfamiliar luxuries, better food, new accommodations, or sandy beaches." At the time, Russians were beginning "to discover that leisure is a time for realizing personal goals and private aspirations." In conclusion, Bryan characterizes the twenty century dilemma in the challenge of leisure time. The Soviet Union is but one example for his vision of the working man. Nearly a decade later, Bryan continued to provide Americans, if not the Anglophone world, with a glimpse behind the Iron Curtain. In a film produced in 1978, Bryan took a new look at the Soviet Union.\footnote{["The Soviet Union: A New Look," \emph{International Film Foundation}. 1978]} Passing from the February revolution with dual power to the Bolshevik seizure of power, Bryan calls the revolution's leaders "Marxist intellectuals," a favorable designation. Bryan traverses the years from Lenin's death to Stalin's ascension, briefly touching on the devastating impact of forced collectivization under Stalin's Five Year Plans. In his designation of the Soviet Union as the sole power in Europe after World War II, Bryan considers the Soviet Union's role critical to the Nazis' defeat. Bryan describes ordinary Soviet life.\footnote{Bryan makes about the notion of a free press is remarkably prescient. In the Soviet Union, Bryan narrates, "all form of communications are controlled by the State; every word in every newspaper and in every book must be approved before publication." Bryan's characterization of the Soviet Union's lack of a free press is precisely the type of control the United States of America has imposed upon its citizens; in the Federal Bureau of Investigation's attacks on the underground press, agents, quite like Stalinist, pursued the purveyors of the free press with an iron fist, grinding numerous American publications into the ground. The FBI's censorship of America's free press during the 1950s, 60s, 70s has resulted in the construction of a modern day state of censorship rivaled only by the late Soviet Union's own. In the book entitled, \emph{Unamerican Activities}, the authors describe how the anti-American Hooverites adopted the Stalinist policies, arresting, for instance, an editor for one of journals the anti-American Hooverite's disliked more than 52 times. Whereas the Stalinist had ceased to arrest artists by the time Bryan released his new look of the Soviet Union in 1978, the FBI was busy persecuting artistic editors by the hundreds, if not by the thousands, to ensure that all forms of communication came under the anti-American Hooverite's control.} Bryan concludes by saying, "Despite the high costs of Stalinism and the war, great progress has been made and Soviet society."}

\entry{Byrne, Oliver} {} {} {Oliver Byrne's chromatic interpretation of Euclid's elements is a pedagogical novelty.\footnote{In his \emph{Victorian book design} from 1963, McLean mentions Byrne's work. The well-known lecturer in the study of information design, Edward Tufte, also refers to Byrne's book in his work on graphic design, a huge cardboard briefcase with a plastic handle containing four indispensable volumes detailing how aura of information in the eye influences the observer.\footnote{These titles represent a high watermark in the history of the data representation: \emph{Beautiful Evidence}, \emph{Visual Explanations}, \emph{Envisioning Information}, \emph{The Visual Display of Quantative Information}. In many of these books are graphics famous not only in the history of statistics but in history in general. \emph{The Visual Display of Quantitative Information}, for instance, displays a sight to behold: Charles Joseph Minard's time-series graph with space detailing Napoleon's devastating losses overtime but pegged to the respective dates of his 1812 campaign for an invasion of Russia with a special emphasis on Napoleon's river crossings. Tufte explains how the graphic "seeming to defy the pen of the historian by its brutal eloquence" combines "data-map and time-series." A brown bar displays Napoleon's invasion; below a black bar displays his retreat. It tells "a rich, coherent story with its multivariate data, far more enlightening than just a single number bouncing along over time." On the black bar "the crossing of the Berezina River was a disaster" with Napoleon losing more than 24,000 men, an enormous amount for a retreat nearly one river crossing from safety. (2001; pg. 40) Tufte claims Minard's graphic may well be the best statistical graphic ever drawn.} In 2010 Taschen republished the work in a facsimile edition.} Published in 1847 by Pickering, the book interprets the figures in Euclid's elements, whose original work contained no diagrams of any type, in terms of color. Prefiguring the modernist experiments of Bauhaus and De Stijl movements, Byrne's elements come to life. While the lively concept of a chromatic interpretation of geometric shapes lights a fire in the imagination full of different colors, the use of colored diagrams and symbols in the ever increasing rigor of Euclid's latter proofs reaches a limit no less elucidating than the letters; a chromatic interpretation of geometric shapes is suddenly no less accurate than an alphabetic one. The overwhelming contrast demonstrates how mathematicians, who are accustomed to view the language of the universe from the practice of their own point of view in the canon, take the assumed media of expression for granted when in all reality the a description of reality may be as diverse as reality itself. Just Desecrates interpreted algebra geometrically, Spinoza metaphysics, or Feynman the heavenly bodies (See Feynman), Byrne's interpretation of geometric with chromata represents a fundamental departure in the presentative historicity of mathematical expression. The fact that Byrne's rendition exceeded no more than Euclid's first six books emphasizes rather than negates the significance of his contribution for that field. Science does not meet art in Byrne's book; it is.}

\entry{Caesar, Julius} {} {} {Julius Caesar, a Roman, transformed Rome. In particular, Caesar implemented a new policy for Rome's money. In multiple ways, Caesar's monetary policy represented a revolution in the history of the Wester tradition. In terms of numismatics, Caesar's introduction of the Aureus, a gold coin, exhibited the superior craftsmanship that conveyed the spirit of Caesar's accomplishments. On January 10, 49 BCE, Julius Caesar crossed the Rubicon with his armies, marching on Rome. He quickly assumed power. The conquerer of Gaul, the single largest territorial acquisition in the history of the Roman empire by a single general, Caesar solidified his role in the history of the Roman empire. To celebrate his achievement, he set about to eradicate not only the debased silver denarius, or penny but the chaos of provincial coinage. He did so with a coin the Roman empire itself, that is, Caesar, issued. While these coins displayed his image, the coins restored the power over Rome's money to the Rome. It removed power over the supply of Roman money from the senators, whose offices both fed or thrived on the corruption money lenders fostered through control over Roman coinage. It represented a significant shift in monetary policy, for the policy not only centralized control over the coin but empowered Rome with the ability to create its own currency. The design of the Aureus, weighing 1/40 of a Roman pound at slightly less than 8 grams, sought to prevent counterfeit coins through sophistication; it relied upon a precise system of weights and measures; it standardized denominations, facilitating the process of prices, thereby allowing merchants to calculate payments for the exchange of goods quickly, efficiently, almost effortlessly. Records of one of the first Caesarian Aureus coins indicate that early in 46 B.C., four years after crossing the Rubicon, Caesar requested the Aulus Hirtius, a praetor with a history of close collaboration, to strike an Aureus with Caesar's likeness. The coin, which bears the legend C CAESAR COS TER, indicating Caesar third consulship, displays a veiled figure, either Vesta, goddes of the hearth, or Caesar himself in his role as Pontifex Maximus, thus highlighting his supreme religious authority. The reverse displays pontifical instruments: a lituus (augural staff), an aspergillum (sprinkler), a sacrificial axe, a simpulum (ritual ladle). The legend reads A HIRTIVUS PR, naming Aulus Hirtius as praetor. These symbols not only reinforced Caesar's image as a religious leader guarding Rome's traditions, its holiest of holies, but presented a degree of sophistication in design hardly replicable but by those most skilled in the art of counterfeit currency. Caesar's face on the coin, however, echoed his accomplishments such as his third consulship but served to guarantee for the citizenry the power of Roman coinage. Backed by the Rome that conquered Gaul, the currency escaped the scrutiny, suspicions, or distrust of those citizens or merchants who might otherwise doubt its solvency, liquidity, value, or exchange value. No longer subject to the whims or fancies of money lenders,\footnote{It is alleged that the primary motivation for Caesar's assassination is not his status, success, or victories but his decision to reform Rome's monetary system, restoring power to the Roman people rather than the money lenders.} the Caesarian Aureus served as a symbol of Rome's power. \newline \indent In terms of economics, however, the numismatic achievements pale in comparison. The Aureus is no comparison to Caesar's obliteration of Roman usury. Caesar's decision to wage war on usury in Rome represented a fundamental break not only in the history of Rome but the Western tradition. It marked a distinct first attempt to introduce an order of rationality in service of need against the irrationality of greed; reorganizing the economy, Caesar's decision checked the uncontrollable interests of unpatriotic Romans against the people's collective satisfaction of needs within a preserved Rome. Caesar's elevation of the interests of the majority of the working people in Rome over those of a few rich, elite individuals organized Rome's economy anew.}

A central lie in the Silicon Valley investors exploit to extract capital from technology on the stock market is kernalization. Similar to the way that Linux distributions are all based on a single kernel, the AI these competing companies are developing may not be truly distinct. Given the priority the Federal government has place on the development of AI there is every reason to suspect that unless or until a reverse engineer demonstrates that the binaries for these programs are truly distinct, these competing Silicon Valley companies, some of which are called, the Magnificent Seven, may be cooperating.} No computer scientist, for instance, utilizes the \emph{Minimalist Program} for parsing natural language sentences. In his own turn, Chomsky associated the responses ChatGPT produces with "glorified autocorrection," disputing the idea that AI generates grammatically sound sentences.\footnote{The fact that ChatGPT generates grammatically sound sentences literally obliterates Chomsky's theory of 'innateness' (i.e., Cartesian dualism) since there is no consciousness associated with ChatGPT.} Computer scientists have utilized a wide range of different linguistic theories for natural language processing (which used to be its own subject of study in academia but has since become subordinated to the study of AI). \newline \indent Chomsky's role in the area of politics sought to present intellectuals with the opportunity to represent the left without Karl Marx.

Although the name of the program is unknown, its purpose is not. Chomsky's book, \emph{Manufacturing Consent}, leaves no doubt about program's purpose. Whereas Chomsky criticizes the "effective and powerful ideological institutions that carry out a system-supportive propaganda function, by reliance on market forces, internalized assumptions, and self-censorship, and without overt coercion," the CIA program teaches its trainees how to empower institutions with ideology for the sake of carrying out a system-supportive propaganda function. By teaching trainees how to rely on market forces, compel journalist to internalize assumptions key to its successful mission or enforce blacklisted ideas for self-censorship, the agency teaches its trainees how to manufacture consent in the American public.

The idea of a communal intelligence should serve to inform its aim with the communal good.} the following:"When our genes were unable to store all the information necessary for our survival, we slowly invented the needed genes.

And so we learned to store vast quantities of information outside our bodies. We are the only species on the planet, at least as far as we known, that has invented a communal memory that is stored neither in our genes nor in our brains.

\entry{Command and Control Economy} {} {} {In a press conference on October 15th, 2025 at the Department of the Treasury\footnote{Is there a basis in the Constitution for a Department of the Treasury?}, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer chastised China for is "command and control" economy, by which the two meant that China's economy is a planned economy. Bessent stated: "Make no mistake, this is China versus the world. They have put these unacceptable export controls on the entire world. China is a command and control economy and we and our allies will neither be commanded nor controlled. They are a state economy and we’re not going to let a group of bureaucrats in Beijing try to manage the global supply chains." Said in the context of a widening struggle over rare earth minerals, critical for the creation of electronics at scale, Bessent's comment demonstrates how naive America's bureaucrats truly are about the American economy. While seeking to distinguish America's economy from China's by reference to an allegation about command and control, both engage in acts designed to further America's own planned economy.\footnote{Professor John Kenneth Galbraith, the Paul M Warburg Professor of Economics at Harvard University in 1966, provided a series of six lectures to the BBC entitled, The New Industrial State. The author of 'The Affluent Society', Galbraith's Reith Lectures explore the economics of production. In his lecture entitled, 'The Role of the State', the fourth lecture in the six part series, Galbraith explains how the modern America state relates to large corporations. He argues that the state has joined private industry, warning against the danger America's involvement in heavy industry presents. In the opening sentence of his lecture, Galbraith says: "I have undertaken to show that in the modern industrial [American] society, or that part of which is compose the large corporations, is in all essentials a planned economy. By that I mean the production decision are taken not in response to consumer demand, as expressed in the market but by producers. The ultimate influence is authority." Made less than 60 years ago, Galbraith's remark is as true today as in 1966, except perhaps with respect to authority. In the United States, the authority to command the controlled American economy through planning has only strengthened in the hands of America's ruling elite. Reading from Galbraith in 1966 to "A Short History of Financial Euphoria," Galbraith's shortcomings, however, become evident. Galbraith's inability to tap the depths of the financial parasitism that characterized the series of mergers and acquisitions, primarily in five waves, demonstrates that even the most clever economic thought may have weaknesses. The financial parasitism that followed most of the 1960s to the present stage of capitalism can hardly be described as euphoria. Explained in his monumental study, Alfred Chandler, Jr.'s Scale and Scope: The Dynamics of Industrial Capitalism (Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard University Press, 1990) described five waves of mergers and acquisitions. The first two waves of merger and acquisitions gave rise to the American corporations for which Galbraith's analysis, no less penetrating at the time than Chandler's now, on planning amongst these corporations. The first two waves took place from 1898 to 1904 and 1916 and 1929; these merges provided for the rise of American corporations to a position of global dominance. In the period of time where Galbraith's analysis is focused, the third wave (1965 to 1969), American corporations shifted away from a pursuit of global dominance towards a response to declining profits resulting from the deterioration in the global status of American capitalism but nonetheless underscored how planning amongst these corporations, although reacting to entirely different circumstances, still maintained centralized planning.} \newline \indent Bessent's and Greer's comment on the Chinese economy is less about China's "command and control" economy than about America's ever widening struggle to remain the world's global superpower on the Grand Chessboard in Eurasia.\footnote{} In the midsts of the Ukraine war, where the United States is no longer able to ensure its continued world dominance through a show of force or the deployment of a Ukrainian proxy force against Russia, the widening struggle to control Eurasia is manifesting itself in multiple different forms. While, on the one hand, the Ukraine war is a war, the direct confrontation of Ukraine with Russia or vice versa is, but one of its manifestations. The struggle to secure, on the other hand, trade routes such as varied forms of the \emph{Baghdadbahn}, important for causing World War I, is an altogether different manifestation; it is neither the first nor the last. In terms of the struggle for raw materials, a direct form is Bessent's and Greer's press conference. The less direct form, however, is the struggle over the future of private central banking. The United States, mired in an irretrievably, exponentially rising, unpayable Federal debt, has exhausted the concept of private central banking, the result of a long history of struggle within the Federal government spanning the entirety of its 250 years of existence from Thomas Jefferson to Abraham Lincoln.\footnote{It is important to remember that the conglomeration of private central banks in Europe have equally exhausted the concept with falling rates of natality, which occurs even in Poland, Europe's rising star.} Should the United States be unable to secure access to, control over, or exploitation of raw materials, rare earth minerals, or precious metals equivalent to the amount of its Federal debt, the advocates for private central banking such as the Federal government's members of the Socialist Equality Party or others supporting the continuation of the current unsustainable American banking practices, of which the IMF, the World Bank or the International Bank of Settlements are merely appendages rather than the main body politic, the United States will have provided the world with the most profound refutation of private central banking in the history of mankind, for neither Russia\footnote{Russia's ability to remain a major great power in the world is partially due to its aversion of private central banking. With the \emph{The Bolshevisks in Power}, the revolutionaries managed to establish power quickly, even though no fewer than fourteen nations attacked the fledgling state in 1918. Although Rabinowitch makes no mention of currency, banking, or debt in his gripping story of the first year of Soviet rule in Russia, the Bolshevik insistence on practicing the Czarist policy of control over the supply of money in the economy played no small part in their ability to extend their rule, however fraught, for many years. In the years following Lenin's death in 1924, Trotsky's struggle with Stalin is hardly ever examined from the point of view of the Soviet monetary policy. Is it that Trotsky's theory of permanent revolution sought to establish a supra-national currency such that two or more countries permanently in a state of revolution consistently fought against the nationalizing interests of a socialism in one country, not the least degradation of which is a dissolution of Soviet power into the hands of private central banking (i.e., in countries such as Poland where private central banking has followed the trend of many former Soviet commonwealth countries after the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991)? Poland is a paragon. The fate of Trotsky's reminiscience on the country played an important role in his famous \emph{Results and Perspectives}, the likes of which played out throughout the Soviet Union's history, first of all with the fateful consequences of Stalin's failed leadership during the civil war, if not with singular importance during World War II in the aftermath of the Molotov-Rippentroff pact, then certainly after, if not following, the collapse. The study of Soviet banking, hardly ever discussed in the litature, is so rife with politicized conspiracy that little useful information has actually emerged from financial Sovietology, despite the obvious imperative for certainy over the implications money had on centralized planning throughout the Soviet economy.} nor China,  practice private central banking. The struggle over Eurasia, less a struggle over whether a leading nation sets the economy in motion according to a plan, is a struggle over banking. Preserving the role of private central banking, perhaps for the last time possible in the Western tradition, is not only at stake but is the most profound turning point in contemporary geopolitics.\footnote{After the repudiation of the monetary policy Lincoln’s greenbacks ushered into existence, a depression enveloped the Reconstruction. Assassinated by agents of international private central banking, otherwise known as “money changers”, Lincoln’s greenbacks, the issuance of currency without the accrual of Federal debt, had represented nothing short of a profound revolution in American history on a level far higher than the mere emancipation of the slaves. The emancipation of the slaves paled in comparison to the persistent role private central banking has played in American history. It terminated the ability of private central bankers to strangle America with debt. In the bullet to Lincoln’s head, Booth ended not only Lincoln's life but more importantly the monetary policy his greenbacks represented. In a study of depression during Reconstruction, the \emph{Reports of the Silver Commission of 1876} (a reprint of Senate Report No. 703 from the 44th Congress),  the authors linkened the situation America faced to that of the Roman Empire’s transition from the era of Christendom to that of the Dark Ages.   “At the Christian era the metallic money of the Roman Empire amounted to 1,800,000,000 dollars. By the end of the Fifteenth century it had shrunk to less than 200,000,000 dollars.... History records no other such disastrous transition as that from the Roman Empire to the Dark Ages.” The U.S.’s current transition, the geopolitics of which are exacerbating daily, is on record to be a more disastrous transition than Rome’s fall into the Dark Ages.} With the fate of private central banking history may well decide the fate of human freedom.\footnote{It is alleged that two economists, Reinhart and Rogoff, who studied not the wealth of nations but their indebtedness, contrived of a scheme by which to rate the viability of repayment or the maturation of insolvency. Designed primarily to justify the imposition of austerity, "Growth in a Time of Debt" has surprisingly little to do with an explanation of America's own Federal debt. The conclusions, neither applicable to America, explain specific but not general phenomena related to nation states without an economy of power. The United States defies both of the conclusions, since America's gross external debt has almost no impact on the annual growth of GDP; when the Federal debt's ratio to GDP represented 60 per cent, annual growth fell by no per cent, or, at least any fall in the percentage of growth does not relate back to the Federal debt in any meaningful way; when the Federal debt's ratio to GDP represented 90 per cent, annual growth fell by no per cent, or, at least any fall in the percentage of growth does not relate back to the Federal debt in any meaningful way; America's Federal debt has surprisingly little to no impact on annual growth. The literature in economics has not established anything but a correlation to specific phenomena primarily for lack of distinction. America's economy is an economy of power. It is unlike the economy of the vast majority of nation-states in the globalized world economy. It thus no wonder that the Silver Commission of 1876 compared the United States to the Holy Roman Empire, for no economy but that one compares. Although Martin Wolfe's claim that the combined GDP of the leading BRICS' nations demonstrate a net annual growth higher than the U.S., merely on account of the principle of unity the claim provides for no comparison. The leading BRICS nations do not or have not formed a whole like the whole to which the economies of the contiginous United States form. GDPs combine in nothing but number for nation-states.}

\entry{transgressions} {} {} {A study of law reveals that the decision to separate crimes so that a misdemeanor is a lesser offense than a felony is obsolete. A higher level of crime, deduced from years of dealing with multiple justice systems, has given rise to what may only be referred to as a transgression, a crime so horrible that not only its commission requires a higher level of scrutiny for its proof upon evidence but its consequence fall outside the traditional scope of remedy. The traditional scope of remedy is often a fine, incarceration or a period of supervision. The traditional scope of remedy, however, falls short for transgression. The idea of transgression is already delineated in criminology. These cases require what may be described as atonement. Atonement ought to be a remedy available for horrible criminals to demonstrate that after a period of time he or she has atoned for the transgression. In the majority of States' Departments of Corrections there is a group of crimes for which the State does not permit a convict to receive so-called earned credit, parole, or commutation. \newline \indent These are generally the following crimes: First degree murder, Second degree murder, Manslaughter in the first degree, Poisoning with intent to kill, Assault with intent to kill, Conjoint robbery, Robbery with a dangerous weapon, First degree robbery, First degree rape, First degree arson, First degree burglary, Bombing, Abuse, neglect, exploitation or sexual abuse against a child, Forcible sodomy, Child pornography or aggravated child pornography, Child prostitution, Lewd molestation of a child, Abuse of a vulnerable adult, Aggravated trafficking in illegal drugs Human trafficking. These crimes are generally what may be called or, at least in terms of the progression of human law, transgressions. Arson, which one of the tools that America's ruling elite utilizes to engage in massive insurance fraud, ought to be a crime whose evaluation relates to atonement. A person who commits arson with no fatalities, for instance, ought not be sentenced for a period longer than is required to atone. Atonement ought to be a demonstration of the belief that as a member of a country's ruling elite with a specific duty to uphold the State's laws a person may not violate those laws to commit an act of corruption in furtherance of a financially beneficial scheme, no matter what the circumstances because corruption results not only in damage to a neighborhood, community or society but undermines the legitimacy of the Country's laws against arson. Circumstances, for instance, may include an agent's affiliation with an agency whose communication with an insurance company allows that agency to commit arson secretly; despite these circumstances, any person thus involved in arson ought to be convicted but to no more time than is required for the person to atone. The vast majority of America's police State bureaucrats commit transgression. Should America collapse, these agents should be convicted of the transgressions they committed to a period of time not longer than required for atonement. Americans are a merciful people but American mercy must be introduced in such a way as to allow for its introduction to proceed with recent developments in law. \newline \indent To the list of transgression there must be added crimes related to the commission of politically motivated criminal activity. Any person employed by the government, agent or otherwise, who engages in an act designed by its commission to be a politically motivated criminal act such as a decision to interfere with a person or persons enjoying basic, civil, human or Constitutional rights ought to be subject to a transgressional indictment. An example is an election. Any person employed by the government, agent or otherwise, who engages in an act designed by its commission to be such a politically motivated criminal act as a decision to interfere with an election or a person or persons enjoying a basic, civil, human or Constitutional right to elect ought to be subject to a transgressional indictment. The corruption in America thus gives rise to a completely new category of criminal activity for which members of the American ruling elite, who failed to uphold his or her commitment to the sanctity of an elected or appointed office of government, must stand to answer for a transgression.}


\entry{"a cruel war against human nature"} {} {} {The majority of America's problems derive primarily from the suppression of Thomas Jefferson's thought. In the Declaration of Independence, Thomas Jefferson described slavery as "a cruel war against human nature" in an early draft but the framers of the U.S. Constitution, especially individuals like Alexander Hamilton, an illegitimate immigrant, a mushroom gentleman, the bastard brat of a Scottish peddler, a Monarchist, an anti-American corruptionist, who would charter the nation's first private central bank in the Congress of the Confederation on May 26, 1781 with its opening on January 7th, 1782 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania,\footnote{The reason so many Americans like Hamilton is not so much his penchant for private central banking but corruption. Hamilton's secret speculation with James Reynolds on bonds he created as U.S. Treasury Secretary coalesced with his illicit affair with Reynolds' wife, a modern day Texas swingger's celebration: corruption and debauchery. Hamilton's confession, an incredible admission, exlaims how Reynolds' wife's seductiveness assumed so many different forms they were almost endless. Who could ever write such a thing about another's man wife after a publicly denounced affair?

The idea that the suppression of Thomas Jefferson's thought might be a cause for the continuation of slavery is untenable for these scholars, since the aim of the 1619 project is not historical truth but the desire to provide a layer of the African-American petit-bougeosie with a argument for reverse discrimination, reparations, or privilege above whites on account of the founding father's racialist motivations. The inversion of the idea that suppression of Thomas Jefferson's ideas is responsible for America's problems, however, is a far worse proposition, since not only does the claim obliterate the racialist narrative; it opens the door to a more far-reaching concept of inalienable rights, equality, life, liberty or the pursuit of property (whose meaning Jefferson envisioned with his repetition of John Locke's wors from the \emph{Two Treatises on Government}.} \newline \indent In his abolition draft of the Declaration of Independence, Thomas Jefferson wrote: "he has waged cruel war against human nature itself, violating it's most sacred rights of life & liberty in the persons of a distant people who never offended him, captivating & carrying them into slavery in another hemisphere, or to incur miserable death in their transportation thither. this piratical warfare, the opprobrium of infidel powers, is the warfare of the CHRISTIAN king of Great Britain. determined to keep open a market where MEN should be bought & sold, he has prostituted his negative for suppressing every legislative attempt to prohibit or to restrain this execrable commerce: and that this assemblage of horrors might want no fact of distinguished die, he is now exciting those very people to rise in arms among us, and to purchase that liberty of which he has deprived them, & murdering the people upon whom he also obtruded them; thus paying off former crimes committed against the liberties of one people, with crimes which he urges them to commit against the lives of another." Jefferson's denounciation of the Christian king of Great Britain with infidel powers for violating not only inalienable but sacred rights to life or liberty advances Thomas Jefferson's thought well past that of the founding fathers.\footnote{[\emph{The Papers of Thomas Jefferson.} Vol. 1, 1760-1776.

\entry{Dalio, Ray} {} {} {Ray Dalio's books are designed to conceal the role money, banking, and finance play in the U.S. economy. In \emph{How Countries Go Broke, The Big Cycle}, Dalio relies on an equation with five variables to explain Big Debt Cycles; these are the following: 1) Big Debt Cycles influence and are affected by largely coinciding 2) big cycles of political and social harmony and conflict within countries that both are affected by and affect 3) big cycles of geopolitical harmony\footnote{The concept of "geopolitical" harmony is one of the static concepts Dalio employs. The concept is static because not only does Dalio treat a country as a unit (which the political form of nation and state simply cannot accomodate) the idea of harmony presupposes an equality of relations; no two countries on the planet, however, enjoy an equality of relations in any sector of the economy; the relations of one economy to another are a reflection of the contentious forms the varied types of comparative advantages forge on a quarterly basis. These comparative advantages never equalize across the board. The factors in economics are not variables but vectors.} and conflict between countries. These cycles in turn are affected by both 4) big acts of nature (droughts, floods, pandemics, etc.), and 5) developments of big new technologies. The formula doesn't add up at all.  None of these touch on a few of the painstakingly detailed histories at the heart of the organic processes leading to a situation like income tax. In the U.S. more than 75 per cent of every dollar the Internal Revenue Service collects from individual workers is transferred to the Federal government for payment on the interest it owes to private central bankers for loans on currency it could issue on its own. Dalio makes no mention of the 16th Amendment. Dalio cannot support his idea of a "Big Debt Cycle" with an antecedent period of time in history primarily because so-called "Big Debt Cycles" do not exist; the U.S. Federal debt is not the result of a "Big Debt Cycle" but a profoundly complex historical process bound up with its money, gold, five periods of mergers and acquisitions, geopolitics, and history. It is by all accounts entirely unique to America. \newline \indent A lot of the analogies Dalio employs to explain component concepts are abstract theoretical ideals.  At one point, for instance, he writes: "It’s like a Rubik’s Cube, in which changing one part of the cube—one driver in the grids shown previously—causes changes to the other parts." Nothing in economy is like a Rubrick's cube because a Rubrick's cube's colors do not brighten or fade over time but factors in the economy are subject to the irretractable law of Heraclitus' river. You never step into the same river twice. The gold you discussed yesterday is not the gold you discuss today or the gold you will discuss tomorrow; the ground is ever shifting so that the stability of a Rubrick's cube is unmistabkly inapplicable to the flux inherent in the economy. The Sixteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, ratified\footnote{An audit of the ratification indicates that states did not following the Constitutionally mandated process. The Sixteenth Amendment is therefore an illegal conspiracy against Americans. An ineffective agency, the IRS has never held to account the culprits responsible for a yoke designed to extract surplus value a third time. The first is the capitalist's share of suprlus value. The second is inflation. The third is the Sixteenth Amendment.} in 1913, for instance, is far in a way different then than now, not because the amendment itself changed; the role, function, or execution of the law, however, has changed significantly; the impact of the money collected by the Sixteenth Amendment's agency, the Internal Revenue Service, an agency within the police State bureaucracy with the power to investigate financial crimes, has changed, just as the money the IRS collects has changed. The dollars in 1913, which could have taken multiple different forms from Morgan silver dollars with three quarters an ounce of silver to Lincoln's original greenbacks, are far in a way different from those often called dollars today, even though the vast majority are nothing more than promissory notes but can be crypto coins. The idea that the factors of the economy like money may be reduced to a single tile on a Rubrick's cube suggests a stability completely incompatible with the reality of economy.

% There is no equivalent for the word "thing" in biblical Hebrew. The word "davar," which in later Hebrew came to denote thing, means in biblical Hebrew: speech; word; message; report; tidings; advice; request; promise; decision; sentence; theme; story; saying, utterance; business, occupation; acts; good deeds; events, way, manner, reason, cause; but never "thing." Is this a sign of linguistic poverty, or rather an indication of an unwarped view of the world, of not equating reality (derived from the Latin word, \emph{res}, thing) with thinghood?

\entity{Davis, Sam} {} {} {Known primarily for his penetrating lecture called \emph{Collateralizing America}, a three part series lasting roughly thirty minutes, Sam Davis is one of the most peculiar skeptical Christian mystics in the history of post-World War II America. There is no preacher like him; no preacher has ever delivered a sermon like his on America. In his sermon, Sam Davis presents a critique of the United States unparalleled by contemporary Christians insomuch as he is not afraid to speak his mind about America; he is not a gnat, a fly on the wall, or a cicada; he is not a man with mere interpretations but a man with an opinion articulated from within the framework of his belief system. Behold a critical thinker. \newline \indent In the vast majority of cases, Christians unlike Sam Davis are fanatically loyal to the status quo ante in the United States without any of the conscious sense of morality Jesus Christ\footnote{It is important to note that far less than being a member of the Jewish community, Jesus Christ was far more a subject in the Roman Republic. In the scenes of the bible, Jesus Christ confronts the inequities in the Roman Republic's rule over Jerusalem, the city of the Holy Temple.} himself preached against empires. \newline \indent If you compare Sam Davis to many of the tele-evangelists like Joel Osteen or to the white, rich privileged publicist Christians like Craig Groeschel\footnote{Groeschel's books like the \emph{Christian Atheist} sell for nothing but their impenetrable superficiality.}, the disparity is so shocking that anyone with a sense of wit to himself or herself cannot help but be so shocked as to entertain momentarily the well-founded suspicion that Sam Davis may not be a skeptical Christian mystic at all but an anarchist anti-Christ. \newline \indent Joel Osteen's vision of America is roses, smiles, or money; he is filthy rich; he wears a black suit; he praises the Lord like a man whose never had to drink from a glass jar or sleep with an extra blanket for lack of electricity but Sam Davis' view of America is history, dates, facts with a discussion of American debt. Why would a Christian like Sam Davis question\footnote{Romans 13:9; Exodus 20:13-15,17; Deut. 5:17-19,21} but not submit to the governing authorities? Unlike Joel Osteen, Sam Davis presents a unified theory of assassination on the assassinated presidents, Abraham Lincoln and John F. Kennedy. Davis claims members of the Federal government assassinated Abraham Lincoln\footnote{One of the most interesting claims that Sam Davis makes relates to the American civil war. Davis claims that America's civil war was not about slavery or freedom, States' rights or the centrality of the Federal government but money. He cites as evidence the hypocrisy of Northerns such as the governor of Maine. Samuel Cony, who served as the 31st governor of Maine from 1864 to 1867, was an abolitionist but allegedly own slaves. He was thus like Thomas Jefferson, who fathered four children with his 14 year old enslaved African American wife.  An abolitionist according to a rejected draft of the Declaration of Independence, Jefferson condemned the King for his support of the practice. Davis claims that Lincoln sought to seize the South's assets to facilitate America's repayment of its debt to France in the Treaty of Alliance from February 6th, 1778. While Davis does not claim that private central bankers upset with Lincoln's greenbacks (i.e., his refusal to pay 36 per cent interest on private loans to the Federal government) are responsible for the assassination, Otto von Bismarck lends credence to Davis' account. Bismarck states: "The division of the United States into federations of equal force was decided long before the Civil War by the high financial powers of Europe. These bankers were afraid that the United States, if they remained as one block, and as one nation, would attain economic and financial independence, which would upset their financial domination over the world." Bismarck contends that Lincoln's death relates to his decision to issue greenbacks. He writes: "The death of Lincoln was a disaster for Christendom. There was no man in the United States great enough to wear his boots... I fear that foreign bankers with their craftiness and tortuous tricks will entirely control the exuberant riches of America, and use it systematically to corrupt modern civilization. They will not hesitate to plunge the whole of Christendom into wars and chaos in order the earth should become their inheritance." Bismarck's account befits Davis on account of Bismarck's affinity with Christendom. Given Bismarck's access to information on the European continent, his account cannot simply be ignored, as most scholars do. The power of these assertions has profound implications for Karl Marx's analysis of the Civil War. Celebrated among Marxists, Marx's account of the Civil War makes almost no mention of the role of geopolitics, finance or private central banking; in his praise of Lincoln, the greatest emancipator of mankind in history, and the North, Marx has almost nothing to do say about money as related to the Civil War. It misses him completely.} for his relation to America's debt. Davis claims John F. Kennedy was assassinated for his decision to eliminate the basis of a "pledge in reorganization" (i.e., the decision to create a currency backed by a precious metal) after John F. Kennedy signed Executive Order 11110 in law on June 4, 1963.\footnote{Research into the history of assassinations in America reveals a tension within the Federal government related to Thomas Jefferson's failure to tender an Amendment for a prohibition against Hamiltonian finance. While many different conspiracies have surfaced regarding Kennedy, such as one claiming the Mossad assassinated him over objections to the Dimona nuclear power plant, cannot compete with the chain of assassinations on presidents opposed to Hamiltonian finance.} Sam Davis claims that upon birth America's ruling elite enter into a ledger a pledge in the amount of 650,000 dollars guaranteeing an American's debts unto death on a person's Social Security number wherein the Federal government trades on "the souls of men" from Revelation 18:13.}


% Given the number of books singing praise to the narrative of emancipation, the idea of an extensive study dedicated to exploring the money, finance, debt, or geopolitics for the Civil War could be groundbreaking, opening up a new canon in the field. There is already substantial material to support the view that Lincoln could not have cared less about the slaves; his proposal for the Emancipation Proclamation, long delayed, came from multiple Union generals who believed that a Southern slave rebellion could prevent a swath of union deaths; fearful generals without Grant's or Sherman's bloodthirsty love of war, Generals Benjamin F. Butler's, General John C Frémont's, and General David Hunter's proposal met Lincoln's rejection; Lincoln wanted a general not for emancipation or civil war but to whip the wealth of rich Southern egalitarian agriculturalists clean, slaves or no slaves.

November 12th, 2025]} What is an abject failure?\footnote{In a critique of Hume's famous contribution to the Enlightenment's debate on causality in the cosmos, \emph{Of Miracles}, John Earman calls Hume's argument against miracles "an abject failure." While offering a new interpretation of Hume's famous "Of Miracles," which notoriously argues against the possibility of miracles (i.e., in an ontic or epistemic sense), Earman tries to show how Hume's argument is admittedly unoriginal or undeniably meritless where original. By situating Hume's popular argument in the context of the 18th century debate on miracles, Earman tries to show how Hume's inductive inference is naive. Earman's primary argument rests on probability calculus. The issue Hume addresses is, namely, how is belief to be apportioned when uniform experience conflicts with eyewitness testimony? Earman criticizes "the quest for a criterion to clear genuine science from pseudo-science." In his evaluation, "the history of these twin quests" has been a failure. He understands the failure to mean, namely, "whether the assertion merits belief and whether the enterprise is conducive to producing well-founded belief." His solution rejects a "simple litmus test" for a proposal encompassing a "detailed, case-by-case investigation." (2000; pg. 3) Comparing Charles Berlitz's \emph{The Bermuda Triangle} (1974) to Larry Kusche's \emph{The Mystery of the Bermuda Triangle-Solved} (1986),  Earman calls such investigations often "unrewarding" and "downright tedious." Ultimately, Earman adjudicates Hume's argument to be an "abject failure" for its unreached ambiguous and confused goals.} Is Putin's 2025 summer offensive an "abject failure"? Is an "abject failure" a project whose unreached goals are confused or ambiguous? Is Putin's 2025 summer offensive a project whose unreached goals are confused or ambiguous? \newline \indent It is unclear from the article in the \emph{The Economist}. It doesn't make sense to talk about a third, if one cannot about a second or first. The article makes no mention of the previous three offensives, when they occurred, how they started or how they ended, which goals the offensives sought to achieve or whether these goals were military objectives, a part of a broader strategy or aligned with a plan for victory in terms military analysts utilize to understand war.

The most likely set of data is based on multiple projects running simultaneously in the field of artillery. One of these relates to completing the updates to NATO's firing tables, military artillery data sheets used for calculating trajectories, for the first time since the Cold War.\footnote{["NATO to make fresh push for common arms standards," \emph{Reuters} October 16th, 2024]} Another is likely the collocation of manuals on targeting, tactics, techniques or procedures\footnote{[https://www.cia.gov/readingroom/docs/CIA-RDP07S00452R000300820008-6.pdf]} for field artillery in combination with the aforementioned firing tables.

At the time of the \textrussian{Джокер}'s announcement, Delta sounded like an unparalleled Ukrainian advantage in software development for the technology of warfare. In video footage from the article, however, Delta is an interactive map with real time updates. While the video footage is only one glimpse at the program, an interactive map could be hardly anything more than a 'novelty' by the New Year. A trend quickly emerged.

These 'mappers' overthrew the interactive maps with news, transforming war coverage forever.

The term political dissident is any person who shares knowledge of the Federal government's secrets, legal or illegal, in any media. The Federal government is so corrupt now that the widened definition of a political dissident is partially responsible for the Federal government's massive expansion into an untold number of police State agencies such as the FBI, CIA (whose violation of the 1947 Nation Security Act is as much established as a practice as its refusal to disclose its budget)\footnote{Antonin Scalia, a conservative with full faith and allegiance to the conspiracy to deprive American citizens of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness through the mass manipulation of American public opinion, issued a rare condemnation of the Central Intelligence Agency in his call for an audit of the agency pursuant to Article 1, Section 9, Clause 7 of the U.S. Constitution. \newline \indent Just like so many of Washington's politicians, Washington's agencies are above the law.

If the Pentagon, DARPA, the US Navy and the Government Office of Accountability is developing or tracking the development of directed energy weapons for "riots," "angry protestors," "control an angry crowd," then there is no reason to believe directed energy weapons for subjecting people to sleep deprivation is implausible.  \newline \indent Given the disrespect America's police State agencies (i.e., the secret Federal police for politics) have for Americans, Americans must take strides to whistleblow, expose, leak, or release information related to defenses to the "Pentagon's Ray [Guns]", since these weapons are already on the record for their deployment against the population for political purposes (i.e., “The Pentagon’s Ray Gun” (i.e., https://www.cbsnews.com/news/the-pentagons-ray-gun/; https://www.cbsnews.com/news/after-120m-pentagons-ray-gun-languishes/)).

Jefferson's successful obliteration of the law is instructive.} \newline \indent Journalists, who are dedicated to First Amendment activity, may source multiple forms of aegis from DEWs from the environment. Anything that emits infrared waves or generate heat through electromagnetic radiation can potentially disrupt, disable, or prevent a malicious, anti-Constitutional, illegal, corrupt, worthless, weak, petty, passive aggressive agent of the State from obtaining the results for which the Federal government, mired in debt, has sought to wield for defense against its irredeemable failure to manage the country successfully, legally, or Constitutionally. These devices are available in the form of home appliances such as coil heaters. Heavy metals such as lead are also a great way to stop DEWs. Although lead is available for purchase online, journalists can easily source lead from tire repair shops, if need be.  Salt water barriers, especially if subject to vibrations, can disrupt the infrared waves, dim their effectiveness, or shorten their range.

\entry{domesticated scientists} {} {} {A trend arising from the domestication of a number of technologies is the rise of domesticated scientists en masse. These technologies combine multiple things at once. The phone (equivalent to a hand held super computer in so much as the size of a phone matches or is more than the size of NVIDIA's Jetson Orin Nano Super computer), for instance, combines the videocamera, video editing, video publishing with Wi-Fi enabled Internet communications. The 3D printer is a manifestation of expanded mental mapping, allowing a person to manifest his or her vision of a specific type of innovation with plastic. The CNC machines are just like the 3D printers but for metals. The development of Amazon-style shipping (where massive amounts of consumer electronics are available almost instaneously from large, robitc controlled, multi-storied warehouses) enables a person to source the combination of multiple different types of microelectronics such as a beeper, a GPS tracking device, a motor, a battery sources for lithium ion batteries, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, or a camera so that these may be instantly embedded into an innovation for electronic functionality. The digital transformation of information (such as advances in OCR) provides people who are interest in the creation of a solution to a problem instaneous access to the history of decision making for the particular field in which his or her invention may lie. The ability to study a specialization online is a key feature; an inventor does not have to wait, pay, or coordinate the development of his or her specialized knowledge through an intermediary like admissions to ensure he or she is able to develop the area of his innovation he or she requires. Whereas in previous eras the gatekeepers of knowledge locked the doors on the masses with fees, admissions, or other types of control mechanisms, the floodgates to knowledge are now open. The last but not least is the rise of AI. While AI experts focus almost exclusively on the features AI does not or cannot ever have, the features AI does have or can develop more fully or implement with greater impact are already quietly at work for innovators. AI has drastically increased search.  Whereas search before the rise of AI merely grasped for words, search now operates on the conceptual, categorical, or essential level together with minutiae to ensure the discovery of an object of information.  Search is now searching for the meaning of the query rather than the query's words.AI's ability to order, organize, or otherwise systemize information is leading search to faster, more relevant, more precise discoveries.  These technologies enable human beings to shift the focus of their innovations away from the material, construction, or knowledge towards the experiments required to ensure their inventions perform the function they envision. \newline \indent In that regard, the key feature of a domesticated scientists is the way they emulate Benjamin Franklin's domestic experiments. The domesticated scientists advance through metacognitive erroneous trials from elementary to advanced innovations singularly from a home workshop. A second key feature is self-documentation. These domesticated scientists film the progression from elementary erroneous trials to advanced inventions with the phone.\newline \indent These features point to the rise of the domesticated scientist en masse. The human ability to self-document the emendation of an erroneous trial from elementary to advanced innovation in major areas of science like aerodynamics or robotic prostheses singularly from a personal laboratory with parts produced by simple plastic on 3D printing machines or metals from CNC machines is a major transformation in the evolution of human living. These domesticated scientists are the first beginnings in the quantum leap that Artificial Intelligence inspires. The lifestyle is a popular lifestyle with hundreds of thousands of people practicing the lifestyle daily. The fact that the transformation has become apparent during the third anniversary of the Ukraine war is indication of just how quickly history has accelerated.\footnote{.In the years leading up to the beginning of the quantum leap, magazines liked \emph{WIRED}, \emph{Popular Science}, or popular scientific journals, magazines, or weeklies never featured the domesticated scientist or his or her inventions.}

Unintelligent orchestration, the German secret police were already subjecting the non-State employed members of the Socialist Equality Party in Germany to surveillance, since the mostly Central Intelligence Agency members of Germany's SEP are cross-deputized members of Germany's domestic secret police.

"The special police commission Soko Linx, which was founded in November 2019 by the Saxon State Criminal Police Office to combat “left-wing extremism,” as reported in an earlier article, is precisely the “sort of joint venture between Saxon police and the far-right scene” required to implement localized orchestration under the auspices of the SEP's supervision. The SEP's supervision is at a high level where the SEP infects the entire movement of the left in Germany so that magazines, periodicals, or newspapers are transformed into levels the party can pull to facilitate orchestration at various levels. It can utilize a petit-bourgeois journal to furnish a take on an entity like Rosa Luxembourg that the SEP subsequently attacks to appear orthodox. In at least one of the articles the SEP describes how the judge presiding over the SEP orchestrated lawsuit against \emph{der Verfassungsschutz} became its leader, indicating how the lawsuit served to celebrate the SEP's orchestration; the SEP trained the judge so that the judge could lead the \emph{der Verfassungsschutz}.

The modern police State bureaucracy, whose transformation in Germany the members of the Socialist Equality Party seek to perfect in NATO Member States in a modified Gladio network, plays with "extremism" from one end of the political spectrum to the other. With access to the personal lives of politically motivated citizens, the police State bureaucracy, whose conception of privacy is non-existent, is able to nudge a precocious youth like Lina Engel into activity the State can thereafter deem "terrorismus." Although Lina likely evoked a German right to a speedy trial, the trial Court deliberately and intentionally delayed, obstructed, or prevented her trial so as to maximimize the time the innocent girl spent languishing in a German detention center. While Lina Engel's case may ultimately be shrouded in mystery, her case brings into sharp relief the role the SEP plays in exporting the American police State bureaucracy in Europe.}

% \newline \indent Eisenberg, an expert in appellate opinions, filed the Petition for Writ of Mandate against Honorary Judge Vance W. Raye. The Petition ultimately led to Raye's removal from the Third District Court of Appeals. It demonstrates just how corrupt the Court truly is. Even if a sound judicial request is briefed thoroughly on the merits, the Court has the discretion to deny any or all requests for relief irrationally, without respect for reason, or in complete contravance against the Constitution, a State constitution or Common Law. In the same way that SCOTUS creates non-Constitutionally based concepts without a single line from the history of common law like the 'Good Faith Exception' to warrants, the Court has the power to respond with equal creativity in its denials. Tani G. Cantil-Sakauye denial of Eisenberg's Petition therefore epitomized the irrationality the Courts reached. It is important to emphasize that the fact that on the surface her denial is not perfectly legitimate, even though the idea of "modern Constitutional authoritarianism" would say otherwise. The irrational denial of a meritorious motion tolls the law of diminishing returns unrelentingly. The credability of the Courts diminishes over time. Even though the diminishment may not be detactable in terms of the power the Court wields, the diminishment's affect is largely binary; in the event of its accumulation over time, the effect can be a complete breakdown such as Civil War, the Emancipation Proclamation, or Reconstruction, the riots against the Dredd Scott case or following the acquital of Rodney King's perpetrators. The unforeseen result of a belief in "modern Constitutional authoritarianism" is the long upward curve on social crises that inevitably occur only after significant periods of time. Within the framework of history, "modern Constitutional authoritarianism" reveals itself to be precisely the type of tactic a lawyer without a case cannot be employ to keep himself or herself employed: procrastination. The implementation of this tactic does nothing but delay the inevitable.    


\entry{Eisenberg} {} {} {Eisenberg is an appellate lawyer from Sacramento, California whose decision to proceed in propria persona in his last case not only resulted in the elimination of one of California's most corrupt appellate judges but demonstrated to the world over just how corrupt California's Courts truly are. 

Eisenberg wrote a fullproof brief. In his brief, Eisenberg accused Vance Raye, a singularly corrupt judge in the Third District Court of Appeal, from refusing to rule on fully briefed appellate cases to ensure that the appellants could not benefit from the Court's rulings until their sentences had already been served, even though Vance Raye's authority to do so is restricted by a number of laws. These laws are the U.S. Constitution's own law forbidding a judge from denying a criminal defendant due process of law; others were from California's own Constitution, stating the same or other things such as the amount of time a judge in a fully briefed appellate case has to rule on the merits. Eisenberg provided a list of cases spanning Raye's entire career in the Third District Court of Appeals. These included the names of dozens of criminal defendants whose cases were fully briefed but without an opinion.\footnote{These criminal defendants' cases like many cases in America were likely rigged by the police State bureaucracy, as the police State bureaucracy has at its disposal a number of tools to utilize to program the selection of a jury pool so that even through selection a criminal defendant may not receive an outcome the police State bureaucracy would not like him or her to receive. The Kalshi company, which is a front company for the deepest agents in the FBI or CIA, have developed algorithms that can analyze with a high degree of predictiability whether or how a person selected for a pool of jurors may rule on the outcome of a case based on factors almost entirely unrelated to his or her criminal behavior. These criteria are based on the principles Nietzsche establishes in his book, \emph{The Twilight of the Idols}, where he claims that ugly people, for instance, are more likely to be convicted of a crime than the aesthetically pleasing. Berating Socrates, the pugnosed philosopher, as belonging to the lowest orders, Nietzsche exclaims how "Ugliness is frequently enough the sign of a thwarted development, a development retarded by interbreeding.  Otherwise it appears as a development in decline. Anthropologists among criminologists tell us the typical criminal is ugly: \emph{monstrum fronte, monstrum in animo}." Nietzsche is a favorite among the deepest agents of the FBI or CIA because of his elevation of social Darwinism over the repudiation of the loser's morality, allowing these deep agents to delude themselves into thinking that they are somehow moralistically superior to the innocent, unsuspecting, unitiated Americans whose lives as guinea pigs they exploit for individual or social experiments in large, unabetted, unknown money laundering conspiracies. It is likely that prior to the release of Kalshi, deep agents from FBI or CIA ran hundreds of thousands of experiments on pools for juries with similiar, if not identical, cases to program the outcome of a trial. Since the selection of pools for juries is no longer random in these experiements, there is a high likelihood that the majority of the cases where the experiments may have been ran resulted in wrongful convictions. }


\newline \indent Eisenberg's brief is a masterpiece in the history of appellate briefing. While Eisenberg's masterpiece has not resulted in his receipt of awards, Eisenberg is most definitely deserving of those awards. Eisenberg should be a judge on the Supreme Court of California so that fellow judges below or beside him look up to him as a manifestation of Right, Law and Justice.    

\newline \indent In California, which is supposed to serve as a model for jurisprudence, the Court system is massive. There are is a Court system for nearly every single one of the 56 counties, incorporated or not, into California; over each of these 56 counties is a system of appellate Courts (whose variety, range, or lack of harmony in opinion is submerged in largest conspiracy of any State's judicial bureaucracy in history with opinion after opinion meaning little to nothing for lack of publication) further divided districts. These District Courts of Appeal, which host an almost innumerable number of judges for lifelong appointments with meaningless specializations in subjects other than law, amount to no fewer than six Districts where the Fourth, being the largest, has three subdivisions (i.e., 1st District is A; 2nd is B; 3rd is C; 4th is D, E, and G; the 5th is F; and the 6th is H) continue to grow almost exponentially at an alarming rate. Over these District Courts of Appeal presides the Supreme Court of California, whose inability to engage in the work for which a supreme Court is designed is not only a well acknowledged fact amongst California appellate lawyers but a mark of the most vile contempt for the uninitiated Californians, whose lives the Supreme Court of California contemptuously wrecks on a weekly, monthly, or yearly basis with garbage opinions (that do not even pretend to harmonize, clarify or settle the law in California). The Supreme Court of California has the largest record of any State for illegible, incoherent, incomprehensible opinions in the history of the United States. The word "California's Courts," however, encompasses much more than the entire edifice of California's Courts but the Judicial Council, which is basically a self-serving institution with no purpose for Californians; alongside the useless Judicial Council is far less useful entity, the Commission on Judicial Performance; last but not least is California'ss State Bar, a manifestation of an aspect of the police State bureaucracy in the form of the bar\footnote{Nothing in the U.S. Constitution authorizes California or any other Court in the United States to establish a bar. The California State Bar's purpose is not to ensure the standards of practice excel to the highest level but to guarantee that any lawyer who fails to bend his or her knee to the powerful ruling elite controlling the strings behind the scenes of the California State Bar are subject to proceedings for disbarment. It is nothing more or nothing less than a petty police force designed to enforce an order people who should otherwise be free to practice however the law so permits. The requirements, which the bar enforces, are among the most petty requirements in the history of a professional service, especially for active lawyers. A lawyer who fails to obey a judge's order such as to award damages to his or her client is better served in a contempt proceeding initiated by the client through application to the ordering judge than by an external third party agency with an undeniable political agenda such as the California State Bar; the judge presiding over the case can easily grant or deny such an application, allowing the lawyer to benefit from due process, the rules of evidence, or the right to appeal so that the ultimate authority lay in the Supreme Court of California where appeals end up anyway. \newline \indent The fact that the greatest men in American history never stood to answer before a bar, one of the many different parasites sucking the blood of America's society, law, or politics, is a testament to a State Bar's lack of utiliaty; Abraham Lincoln, the greatest president since the founding fathers, never passed a test to become a "bar" certified lawyer; he never stood to bar; he never had to become subjec to an State Bar in Indiana because no such thing existed. If Abraham Lincoln, doubtlessly so like the many others who came before him, was able to practice the law honestly, competently, or professionally without a bar, no bar is necessary. Its licensing fees are unnecessary; its requirements for courses are unnecessary. It is an entirely unncessary service. Attorney's fees, usually under 10,000 dollars, ought to be a matter for small claims; an attorney who routinely ends up in small claims court for a failure to serve his or her client is thereby easily subjected to a client's background check in the small claims court. }. 

\newline \indent While California's governor, Gavin Newsom, the Nero of California, a spoiled, heir to Nancy Pelosi's political dynasty, a relative to Tom Siebel's multi-billion dollar family, has watched California burn or slip down the side of mountains or hills in mud slides, has boasted of California's success in terms of its economy, little to nothing has been done to improve the basic standard of living for the people, of which not only the economy but the society, its institutions or their influence on everyday Californians play a role. In terms of California's corrupt legal system, Newsom has done absolutely nothing to address Ray's victims. Newsom has allowed the entire affair to be swept under the rug, as though nothing happened; Newsom, for instance, has not called on the Judicial Council, which handles California's  online dockets, to restore Eisenberg's case to the public, allowing the Judicial Council to continue its concealment of Eisenberg's brief. Newsom has not called on the Supreme Court of California to review the ruling it issued in Eisenberg's case. Newsom has done aboslutely nothing to address, let alone remedy, the injustice either Ray or the California Courts have caused; he has made no effort to improve the responsibility the California Courts have to California's residents. 

\newline \indent Newsom has not directed California's attorney general to review meritorious submissions to the Office of Attorney General for bills citizens have proposed for improving California's Courts, the scope of judicial power, or its laws; he has been completely silent on a number of bills, the most remarkable of which is a bill to require child custody to become subject to a jury. Newsom, who is supposed to be a champion for civil rights, has insisted on the scope of judicial power continuing to encompass orders on child custody without juries. Although judges prefer juries over bench trials, Newsom has not said a word about the proposed law the former Attorney General Anthony Baccera rejected without a proper legal basis. 

\newline \indent  Newsom's governorship is best summarized in the results of California's High Speed Rail Project. Established by votes in a referendum, California's High Speed Rail Project has not laid a single line of track. Californians can travel no where in the state on a high speed rail like the one for which they thought they approved in a referendum. 

\newline \indent Newsom is a privileged member of a political dynasty with no political prospective for Californians, let alone Americans. His governorship over California has witnessed the State burn; Paradise, for instance, burned to the ground under his watch, even though California has the resources, money or time to emasticate the forests against fires. California's houses are falling down mounds, hills, or mountains from endless, recurring, geologically predictable landslides. Even in the richest neighborhoods where some of California least useful bureaucrats reside, such as El Dorado Hills, houses are slipping down hills. His refusal to require California's Courts to conform to California's Constitution, to clarify, settle, or harmonize California's appellate opinions, or to allow bills citizens propose to reach the ballot demonstrates that Newsom is no less fit to govern California than the United States. 

\newline \indent Newsom's decision to run for president began to circulate widely throughout social media during the second anniversary of the Ukraine war when a mock political debate put him before Florida's governor, Ron DeSantis, a straightforward, translucent, results-driven politician, whose State's high speed rail began to transport Floridans within less than two years. During the third anniversary, Newsom began to deny actively whether he has or hasn't committed to a run for president. In his denials, he has listed various achievements for California such as its status as the fourth largest economy in the world but has never addressed any of the issues facing everyday Californians.  What role has Newsom played in a distinction California has carried for decades? California has been a leading economy in the world for years before Newsom's election. The fact that California is the fourth largest economy in the world further underscores the pressing need for resolution to the problems everyday Californians face.

In terms of the individual, Feynman believed that an ordinary person could become a scientist like himself with study. In an interview he points to himself. He said: "You asked me, if an ordinary person by studying hard, would get to be able to imagine these things like I imagine. Of course, I was an ordinary person who studied hard. There's no miracle people. It just happens they got interested in this thing and they learned all this stuff. They're just people. There's no talent, a special miracle ability to understand quantum mechanics or a miracle ability to imagine electromagnetic fields that comes without practice and reading and learning and study so if you say you take an ordinary person who's willing to devote a great deal of time and study and work and thinking and mathematics and time, then I think he's become a scientist."\footnote{The operative verb in Feynman's vocabulary is a distinctly characteristic belief of the Enlightenment Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel established in his \emph{Phenomenology of Spirt}. Just as the Greeks and Romans believe, Hegel furnishes the human capacity for intelligence less in memory or cognition than in the imagination.}

Struck on October 6th, 2025, the military objective of the attack focused on an iron ore processing and extraction site in Russia where Russia sources no less than 50 per cent of its iron ore for production, or roughly 40 million tonnes a year. It consisted of two GOKs (i.e., \textrussian{Горно-обогатительный комбинат}). The extraction sites operate approximately twenty 300 to 750 tonne quarries for crawler excavators. These machines, incredibly large, slow, cumbersome piefces of equipment, make for extremely easy targets. The hydraulic systems of these machines are enormous; the hydraulic fluid is extremely flammable. If it is catches fire, the entire machine becomes engulfed in unquenchable flames as though hit by Greek fire. The machines are unbelievably expensive; they require shifting resources from Russia's war machine back to civilian tools; the time to produce such machines can shut down a civilian workshop converted to Russia's war machine for weeks, if not months. The Ukraine's attack on the town of Staryi Oskil thus sought to shut down Russia's ability to source more than 50 per cent of its iron ore.} a scholar by the name of Alfred McCoy\footnote{It is most likely that McCoy derived his theory on energy from an expanded reading of Christopher Dunn's \emph{The Giza Power Plant} (2000) where the author attributes the source of Egypt's great society to the pyramid. Based on the science of harmonic resonance, Dunn claims the pyramids were an acoustic device designed to generate power for the ancient Egyptians. Dunn's account is an excellent source of information on argumentation. Dunn's claim, for instance, about the hallow sarcafagos in the pyramid is an example. Dunn explains that the precision with which the Egyptians hallowed the sarcafagos, whose quartz stone could not have sustained direct strikes from a hammer, suggests the use of what is the equivalent to a sophisticated mill or an advanced router, for which there is no trace on earth. While development is uneven, the idea that the hallowed sarcafagos cannot be explained otherwise is no less definitive than the conclusion he reaches about the pyramid. The measurements for the sun are suggestive but the suggestions extend without support. Dunn hypothesis, nonetheless, implies energy is a source of prosperity but the Romans lived for millenia on nothing but water, manpower and the horse.} delivered an interview on one of the CIA's long funded means for the spread of disinformation, the so-called Democracy Now! news channel (which has featureed Noam Chomsky for an untold number of interviews. On the interview McCoy claimed that global empires rise by mastering new energy systems, as China continues to do so with renewables. "China is absolutely dominant in every aspect of this green energy revolution," says McCoy. McCoy's claim, however, is complicated by the example of Sumer.\footnote{The example is significant, for Sumer is the cradle of civilization. The documentary, for instance, references the Old Testament. It references Genesis 2: 10-14, Genesis 11: 3-4, and Genesis 11:8. If the French explanation of Sumer's extinction were not credible, the verses from the Old Testament would have to be explained in an altogether different way, wouldn't they?} \newline \indent In a four part documentary in French, French scholars explore four ancient civilizations. Called \emph{Civilizations}, the documentary features \emph{\textfrench{les Sumeriens}} first of all. \textfrench{Il y a 5 000 ans, les Sumériens bâtissaient les premières grandes cités de l’Histoire, inventaient l’écriture, la roue, le contrat, et irriguaient le désert pour le transformer en Eden. Mais cette civilisation brillante, née entre le Tigre et l’Euphrate, a disparu, vaincue par le sel, les invasions et le temps. Découvrez leur héritage, leurs dieux, leurs mythes et les raisons de leur chute.} \newline \indent Towards the end, the documentaire raises the following question: "\textfrench{Comment t'expliquer la disparition d'une civilisation aussi brillante}?" A French scholar from the documentaire attributes \emph{\textfrench{les raisons de leur chute}} to a new discovery: "Est-ce qu'on peut parler d'un déclin? Dans une certaine mesure, oui, mais peut-être plutôt d'une sclérose." \newline \indent He continues, saying: "\textfrench{Toutes ces grandes découvertes réalisées par les gens de du 4e millénaire, toute le pensée qui se concrétise par des manifestations religieuses ou disons dans le cadre du religieux, toutes ces choses-là évoluent et vu à longue échelle, on s'aperçoit qu'il y a de moins en moins de liberté possible dans l'expression d'un certain nombre de choses. Par exemple, l'art mesopotamien est infiniment plus divers, plus florissant, au 3e millénaire que au premier millénaire.  Qu'est-ce qui se passe en la premiere millénaire? Vers  la premiere millénaire, c'est la découverte du fer. La fer est un atout. Le fer est quelque chose de plus efficace que le cuivre et par certains côtés plus facile à travailler même s'il faut une température plus forte à des applications encore plus nombreuse. Donc c'est une amélioration mais l'environment de la Mésopotamie n'est pas en fer et le problème des sources va se poser parce que il faut aller beaucoup plus loin et par conséquent les régions qui ont du mineret de fer vont jouer un rôle beaucoup plus fort que la Mésopotamie.}" \newline \indent The French scholar thus attributes the cause of Sumer's extinction to the relatively long distance Sumerians travelled from their cities to sources of iron ore. The lack of access to, control over, or exploitation of raw materials, rare earth minerals or precious elements such as uranium, lithium, gold, silver or palladium are responsible for determining whether a civilization prospers or transpires. Applied to China, China's energy production is reliant upon precious elements, rare earths, or raw materials, the majority of which China streamlined to facilitate its ability to construct major energy projects like the Talatan Solar Park. It is thus China's access to, control over, or exploitation of raw materials, minerals, or rare earths that is responsible for its ability to build infrastructure for sources of renewable energy such as the Talatan Solar Park. Hence access to, control over, or exploitation of raw materials is prior to culling, constructing, or exploiting sources of energy. McCoy's claims must therefore be rebased from sources of energy to sources of raw materials.

The Ukraine war underscored how naval power together with the ability to regenerate a fleet at scale has restored a central feature of great power struggles from the 20th century. Within great powers struggling to assert dominance over a maritime trade route or an entire sea such as the Baltic Sea (called a NATO lack during the Biden administration), the Black Sea, the Red Sea, the Straight of Tiran, the Straight of Hormuz, the South China Sea, or the Straight of Taiwan (where no fewer than three trillion dollars pass yearly, according to an article published by Sky News Arabic on September 14th, 2025 under the title, "\textarabic{الصين تحذر الفليبين من "الاستفزاز" في بحر الصين الجنوبي}), the concept of naval power heralds a new era in the strategic value of oceanic combatants or capital ships not merely for protecting a nation's international standing but ambitions for markets, trade, or commerce in an anarchical global economy without a single superpower to dictate policy, law, or power relations, indicating that a fundamental change in relations at sea has occurred.

It will make the world poorer, and Donald Trump's use of companies as a tool of state will make it less safe, too."} Within the context of these changes, the struggle to broker a compromise against the dangers the bleeding edge of technology presents to aircraft carriers but aimed at the expansion of a fleet, despite the challenges shipbuilding presents to countries like the U.S. (with multiple classes of destroyers), has given rise to a struggle to design the most powerful, lethal, fast frigate. The frigate, neither a small ship nor a ship with guns a navy cannot lose like those on a destroyer but certainly not the type of ship a military budget cannot produce within a few weeks (i.e., an aircraft carrier), is now the focus of great powers from one end of the earth's surface to the other, especially in the United States.

Of 1905, Trotsky wrote: "As agreed, the march to the palace was a peaceful one, without songs, banners, or speeches. People wore their Sunday clothes...The soldiers fired all day long. The dead were counted in the hundreds, the wounded in the thousands. An exact count was impossible..." . \newline \indent During the 1905 uprising, Trotsky became the Chairman of the Petrograd Council of Workers' Deputies. December 2nd, 1905, Trotsky declared: "The autocracy never enjoyed the confidence of the people and was never granted any authority by the people. We have therefore decided not to allow the repayment of such loans as have been made by the Tsarist government when openly engaged in a war with the entire people." It is only after Trotsky declared he would not authorize the repayment of Czarist debts that government troops surrounded the Soviet with a warrant for his arrest. On December 3rd, 1905, the Czar arrested Trotsky. On October 4th, 1906, Trotsky, who appeared in propria persona without counsel, made a famous speech where he derided the Czarist government's false, factually unsubstantiated, politically motivated claims that he had fomented a rebellion. In response, Trotsky famously remarked: "You cannot prepare a revolution. You can only prepare for a revolution." The Czarist judges, who forsook law for obedience to the Czar, proceeded with the malicious prosecution, falsely convicting him with a sentence for exile to Siberia. \newline \indent After escaping, Trotsky wrote a book called \emph{1905}. Trotsky's book on \emph{1905} is one of the first expositions of the politicization of the general strike for the ascension of worker power in the history of mankind.\footnote{Suppressed within the Socialist Equality Party, the book is considered to be incapable of inversion. While the terminology associated with the process of a general strike may be mocked many times over for orchestration, the actuality of a general strike is far too chaotic to be without the risk of lost control. The SEP thus focuses training for candidate members away from the uncontrollable to the controllable. The party focuses on Trotsky's \emph{Results and Perspectives}, or, \emph{The Russian Revolution}, both of which are capable of inversion for deployment against workers in regime change operations.} It contains a detailed history of Trotsky's observations in the months following the aftermath of the Czar's decision to transform Father Gregory Gapon's march into a massacre. The result rebounded. The attempt to suppress the protesting workers with a massacre fueled the fire of rebellion many times over. The workers, who previously sought to do nothing more than march on the Winter Palace with a petition, began to organize for the Czar's overthrow. The Czar's massacre thus undermined his initial desire. \newline \indent Trotsky details these events with stunning accuracy. Although he far removed from the uprising in the Black Sea, Trotsky recounts the red mutiny.

\entry{gay divorce} {} {} {The lack of gay divorce in American society is a multifaceted conspiracy against heterosexual couples, child birth, and the nuclear family. In contrast to homosexual couples, heterosexual couples are required to consummate a marriage within a State but the modern American state where American heterosexuals consummate marriage, is designed less to ensure matrimony until death but to profit from the eventual destruction of the family until death. The lack of gay divorce, however, safeguards homosexuals from the parasites that cling to the nuclear family; gays are not required to marry so they are not required to divorce. They're free to move from one relationship to another or the dominant homosexual is free to continuing dominating the subdued homosexual.\footnote{A great many of the subdued homosexuals in homosexual relationships look for a way out of the relationship but the fact that the subdued homosexuals are necessarily in place to guarantee at least one aspect of the multifaceted conspiracy against heterosexual couples forbids the modern American state from pondering the considerations at its disposal for the emancipation of the subdued homosexual. It would not make sense, for instance, for the modern American state to allow subdued homosexuals to exploit the generally accepted justification for females. A subdued female homosexual filing a petition for a restraining order because she wants to prevent her dominant homosexual partner from "rapping" her undermines the utility value of "rape" for married women with a male husband. A certain degree of steadfast definition, the likes of which gay divorce threatens, is required to guarantee the overall utility value of heterosexual divorce for the conspiracy. The result is that dominant homosexuals, male or female, are able to continue to dominate their subdued partners, maintaining control over the relationship, children, or property. It means that homosexual relationships provide a far more powerful role in American society for a dominant personality to persist than a heterosexual marriage. Consequently, homosexual relationships are far more private, consistent, or maintained than heterosexual relationships because none of the partners have a recourse or remedy the modern American state would like to exploit for its voracious appetite of destruction.} \newline \indent The modern American state manifests the vast majority of these parasites, celebrating their existence with honorific titles as though they were contributing value to society when in all reality they are merely hastening its destruction for personal gain. These parasites are the "family" law lawyers, social workers, judges, or Courts, the vast majority of which could not function for gay divorce for lack of marriage, children or property but for marriage, children or property now find meaning as a "family lawyer," a "family law judge," "child social worker," not from heterosexual marriage but divorce. Not only do heterosexual divorces sustain a major function of the parasitic police state bureaucracy (i.e.,"family" law lawyers, social workers, judges, or Courts) but make a tremendous amount of money from their hosts, sucking their blood for years on end. In comparison to the amount of money generated from gay divorce, heterosexual divorce is a major market for the State; "family" lawyers file petitions for dissolution, child social workers concoct diagnoses for prescription medicine from therapy sessions charged to the dissolution, "family" law judges make rulings, the "family" law Courts produce opinions.\footnote{The fact that Americans do not read the opinions appellate Courts issue not just on family law but on all matters concerning the Courts is one of the major reasons Americans remain in the dark about the trappings of the modern American state; of the ones who are capable of reading, few of these interest themselves in the opinions of the Court, even though these are promulgated.} Homosexuals are not only immune from but do not contribute to the amount of money the State extracts from the labor value of familial dissolution.

\entry{Geymonat, Ludovico} {} {} { Ludovico Geymonat (May 11th, 1908 - November 29th, 1991) produced a seven volume work on philosophy called \emph{Storia del Pensiero filosofico e scientifico}, published by Garzanti in Milano, Italy from 1970 to 1976, with far more depth than the no less handy Dictionary of Philosophy by Blackwell. It contains the following in the following order: Storia del pensiero filosofico e scientifico. I: l'Antichità, Il Medioevo. II: Il Cinquecento, Il Seicento. III: Il Settecento. IV: L'Ottocento. V: Dall'Ottocento al Novecento. VI : Il Novecento (1). VII : Il Novecento (2).

In the first volume, Geymonat, for instance, discusses how "La scuola pitagorica rappresenta un movimento di pensiero di livello scientifico molto superiore a quello della scuola ionica." \newline \indent Geymonat's encyclopedia, however, is just not historical; it is analytics. In opposition to the great number of enthusiasts for sets, Geymonat subtly lays out « aritmo-geometria » where "[in] particolare, la concezione ora spiegata spinse i pitagorici a studiare la geometria per via aritmetica." Geymonat's extensive knowledge of mathematics thus positioned him ahead of his times for a renaissance in the study of geometry. \newline \indent It is one thing to assemble an encyclopedia; it is an altogether different thing to assemble a historical encyclopedia with an emphasis on a space in time. Geymonat's contribution refocuses our attention away from knowing this or that philosophical or scientific thinker to experiencing their contributions with chronology. Written entirely in simple Italian prose, Geymonat's easily readable encyclopedia in seven volumes thus provokes readers to take up a study of the Italian language.\footnote{}

\entry{Gladio} {} {} {The operations the Central Intelligence Agency conducts on the soil of Eastern Europe recalls the sinister campaign of Gladio.\footnote{A trilogy produced by the BBC details how the CIA played a role in manipulating the political affairs of post-war Europe through an operation called Gladio. The documentary is called, \emph{Gladio}. Named after the codename for the clandestine "stay-behind" operations of armed resistance organized throughout the Western Union or the Brussels Treaty Organization (BTO), and subsequently by NATO and the CIA, in collaboration with several European intelligence agencies. Organized on the death of Operation Unthinkable, Gladio sought to thwart a potential Warsaw Pact invasion and conquest of Europe. Although Gladio refers specifically to the Italian component of NATO "stay-behind" operations, "Operation Gladio" is used as the catch-all for the sum total of all the operations within its mission. Based on interviews with Vincenzo Vinciguerra, from his jail cell in Italy, by Libero Gualtieri, who spearhead the Italian Parlimanet's Inquiry into Operation Gladio, the series details how the CIA perpetrated systematic, illegal, anti-Constitutional acts of terrorism in Italy during the "Years of Lead" (late 1960s to early 1980s). In 1990, the European Parliament adopted a resolution alleging that military secret services in certain member states participated in crime and terror. The resolution also urged investigations by the judiciaries of the countries in which those armies operated, so that their modus operandi and actual extension would be revealed. To date, only Italy, Switzerland and Belgium have had parliamentary inquiries into the matter. \newline \indent The three inquiries reached very different conclusions indeed. Guido Salvini, a judge from the Italian Massacres Commission, concluded that some of the right-wing terrorist organizations active during the "Years of Lead" such as La Fenice, National Vanguard, or Ordine Nuovo were the trench troops of a secret army, remotely controlled by exponents of the Italian state apparatus and with verifiable and evidenced ties to the CIA. The Swiss inquiry, on the contrary, found that British intelligence secretly cooperated with their army (i.e., Switzerland's) in an operation called P-26, providing training in combat, communications, and sabotage. It also discovered how P-26 not only organized resistance to the possibility of a Soviet invasion but also stipulated to its activation, should a left wing party ever succeed with a sufficient number of votes to guarantee a majority in parliament in a clear repudiation of democracy. The Belgian inquiry, the least conclusive of all, found no evidence to support claims about the Belgian army. It found no links between the Belgian army and terrorist attacks but noted that Belgium's secret services refused to provide the identity of agents. A 2000 Italian parliamentary report from the left wing coalition Gruppo Democratici di Sinistra l'Ulivo reported that men inside Italy's State institutions who maintained ties to American intelligence conducted terrorists massacres and bombings. The report also said that the United States was guilty of promoting a strategy of tension. Operation Gladio is also suspected to have been activated to counter existing left-wing parliamentary majorities in Europe. In a brazen denial of its past crimes, the US State Department, whose history is a history of criminality from South America to Europe in the post-WWII order, published a communiqué in January 2006 that stated claims the United States ordered, supported, or authorized terrorism or stay-behind units, and US-sponsored "false flag" operations are rehashed former Soviet disinformation campaigns based on documents the Soviets forged.}

\entry{Glass, Philip} {} {} {Philip Glass is an American composer who is the first in the history of music to compose an opera on Akhenaten, Amenhoptep IV, the Egyptian Pharaoh whose decision to draw Egypt's worships away from demiurges to the sun alone marked a distinct break in the history of human monotheism. In Act 2, Scene 4, the sopranno sings Akhenaten's great hymn to the only god Aten, one of the earliest renditions of sun-worship in the history of mankind. Glass follows the hymn with the superimposition of Psalm 104 in Hebrew, eliciting the ancient Egyptian origins of monotheism for the Abrahamic faith in a widely celebrated theme in the tradition of Western classic music.\footnote{George Frideric Handel's biblical oratorio, \emph{Israel in Egypt} (1739) or Giuseppe Verdi's Nabucco (1841).}  The culmination of a trilogy including two other biographical operas, one called \emph{Einstein on the Beach}, the other \emph{Satyagraha}, Akhenaten is the first in the celebration of individuals whose inner vision not only altered the age in which they lived but the future course of mankind. While the most cliché typification groups Akhenaten with religion, Einstein with science or Ghandhi with politics, the ideas these revolutionary visionaries implemented in society intercrossed the entirety of society. Written in 1983, Glass' Akhenaten celebrated its fortieth anniversary during the Ukraine war's first anniversary.} 

\entry{gold} {} {} {} {In a historic rise unlike any previous period of time, gold's significance against the backdrop of the Ukraine war has emphasized the role currencies play in the struggle for great powers to become the world's only superpower. On February 1st, 2022, a troy ounce of gold cost 1797.91 dollars. On October 17th, 2025, the price for a troy ounce of gold surpassed 4,378.69 dollars, the highest in the precious metal's history. By January 21st, a troy ounce of gold rose to the price of 4,866.80 USD, a new historic high. \newline \indent Sanctions, more than any other factor, has played the greatest role in the rise of gold. While many may claim Biden is responsible for the sanctions, Donald J Trump refused to terminate Biden's sanctions. The idea that Biden is responsible for the sanctions is thus only a half-truth. \newline \indent The historic rise of gold spelled the beginning of the end for America's dollar. While the dollar's collapse is a complex process, perhaps even more complex than the causes for the Ukraine war, the beginning of the historic rise of gold preceded the urgent flight of capital from the United States to foreign bank accounts or the purchase of the precious metal. \newline \indent On January 30th (Friday), 2026, the Federal government prompted JP Morgan Chase to initiate a major withdrawal of the market share in gold to precipate volitility in a historic short sale.\footnote{During the winter social media influencers with anonymous or non-individually identified accounts touted the idea that the Federal government would repay the Federal debt by manipulating cryptocurrency. The short sale on precious metals, however, wiped cryptocurrency out. The precious metals rebounded on fundamentals. Cryptocurrency trades at less than negative 4 percent return on investment without fees. There is no way the myth of cryptocurrency manipulation will save the Federal government's Federal debt. The more than 10 trillion in U.S. Treasuries the Federal Reserve believes debt holders will roll over into new treasuries with a higher yield not only won't happen, especially by law. \newline \indent While money market funds, fixed-income investors, foreign countries, insurance companies, individuals, and corporations are legally required to hold short-term Treasury notes,​ a claim subject to dispute, the rollover is, nonetheless, expected exacerbate the crisis of the collapsed dollar, since 1) the dollar is no longer the world’s reserve currency; gold surpassed the dollar in reserves, diminishing its role for reserve; 2) commodities contracts are increasingly being settled in currencies other than the dollar with the Chinese renimbi, Indian rupee, Russian rouble, and U.A.E dirham in heavy competition with the dollar; 3) central banks prefer to purchase gold over U.S. treasuries  (i.e., India prefers gold over U.S. Treasuries). As PIMCO states, the shift in preferences “has profound implications. U.S. current account data shows equity inflows remain strong, while fixed income allocations grow increasingly selective. Central banks and institutional investors are reassessing dollar concentration, seeking alternatives that don't penalize prudent risk management.” (December 31st, 2025) 4) While the preference to purchase gold over U.S. Treasury has profound implications, U.S. sanctions provide a positive economic incentive for countries like Russia and China to dump U.S. Treasuries; China, for instance, China has slashed its Treasury position by over $600 billion since the 2013. 5) Even worse than preference or dumps is China’s active manipulation of U.S. Treasuries. China has begun to utilize U.S. Treasury to diversify economies within its spheres of influence away from the dollar to the Chinese\footnote{[“China’s Holdings of Gold v. U.S. Treasuries,” \emph{Bloomberg}. January 20th, 2026]}, effectively forcing the U.S. monetary policy to try a taste of its own medicine.  The U.S. has a six to nine months runway before the dollar dies. It has already collapsed in the sense in which the dollar existed prior to the 2008 financial crisis, whose ultimate expression terminates in the dollar's inevitable death. Gold has begun to move in multiples, dashing from 4600 to 5600 in less than a week; a JP Morgan Chase's failed State orchestrated short sale could not prevent gold from regaining 50% of its lost value in less than a week. Physicists often talk about how time does not exist. If the measure by which time were to be evaluated switched from the sun to the dials, gauges, or indicators of the economy, physicists would be shocked by how times have changed. These quantities are leading to a change in quality. Hence these factors, all of which have come to a head in 2026, demonstrate that the mode of existence the dollar enjoyed prior to America’s shift to a great power competitor with Chinese superpower, exists no longer. These five factors have not just profound but life-alterating consequences for the state of the American economy. \newline \indent On the day JP Morgan Chase executed the failed State orchestrated short sale of precious metals, India’s stock exchange surged. The financial ruling elites celebrated by transferring America’s wealth directly away from the United States into hard assets in this country’s stock market and others, robbing the American people blind. The majority of these hard assets are being transferred to the Indian stock exchange in a well designed scheme; the scheme allows the United States to sell India its crude, if not from the U.S. than from Venezuela, for hard assets or rupees, both of which serve as a hedge against the collapsed dollar. This is only one of the many schemes designed to thwart the inevitable loss of value the American dollar’s death will cause at the end of its collapse.} On January 30th, 2026, no more than a few weeks before the fourth anniversary of Ukraine's war, gold rose to more than 5,600, exceeding nearly every single forecast major FOREX, currency, or stock market analysts assessed for the precious metal. At the outset of the rally, gold reached more than $5,600. On January 28th (Wednesday), gold came within 300 dollars from exceeding the Yardeni Group's prediction for the precious metal to reach $5,600 before the end of the year. Gold began moving in multiples. At the beginning of the week gold moved by roughly 100 every 24 to 48 hours, resiliently resisting the corrections speculators cause by trying to short sell. On January 27th, 2026, BMO published a report, claiming a "bullish scenario [for] gold at 8,650" dollars. The prediction went on to state how "[surging] momentum in gold and silver reflects a shifting order in the  global marketplace, as uncertainty over the future of government balance  heets and fiat currency resilience dominates investor sentiment,  according to one Canadian bank..." This prediction, however, stood in contrast with the earlier predictions gold had already defied. Gold invalidated the following predictions: JPMorgan Chase: 5,055, up 16.45 percent, Charles Schwab: 5,055, up 16.45 percent; Bank of America: 5,000, up 15.18; ANZ Bank (Australia): 5,000, up 15.18 percent; Deutsche Bank: 4,950, up 14.03 percent; Goldman Sachs: 4,900, up 12.57 percent. Morgan Stanley: 4,800, up 10.57 percent; Standard Charter Bank (UK): 4,800, up 10.57 percent; Wells Fargo: 4,500 to 4,700, up 3.65 percent to 8.26 percent; more than 9 of the major Western financial analytics firms have fallen short by more than 200 to 700. Gold exceeded the Jefferies Group at: 6,600, up 52.04 percent and the Yardeni Group: 6,000, up 38.21 percent. What happened throughout the invalidation of predictions from market assessments major banks produced is that gold began to demonstrate resistance to speculation. The corrections are short, immediate, trivial. A comparison of prices from latter in the day at 5,179.70 USD to that earlier in the day 5, 202.20. $22.5 contrasts minimally with fees reduces the money a short seller might earn to a miniscule amount.Given the resistance to speculation, pressure continued mounting on supply, pushing gold up. By January 30th, gold had already exceeded nearly every one of the predictions major banks produced in an assessments. \newline \indent By the morning of January 30th (Friday), gold experienced the greatest single day of volatility, since 1983. In just one hour, gold lost approximately 3.2 trillion of its market value, equivalent to about 58 billion per minute, before a major recovery. Gold receovered 2.3 trillion almost immediately. The price restored to $4,900 or more. \newline \indent The most pro-Western news agencies, many of which are Arabic, associated the fall in the price of gold with Donald J Trump's decision to nominate economist Kevin Warsh but the idea that the world would so enthusiastic about the Kevin Warsh's appointment to the chairman of the Federal Reserve belies the fundamentals in the global economy. Although designed to undermine the rally gold exhibited in the months leading up to the day, the Federal government's manipulation of the market for gold met with definitive limitations. Gold, for instance, overtook the U.S. dollar as the largest global reserve asset. While gold may drop temporarily, private central banks have not restored the practice of trading gold for U.S. treasuries but are insisting on the opposite: ditching U.S. treasuries for gold, a decision the Federal government's 40 trn debt dictates for monetary policy. Institutionalized short selling has not stopped gold. Resilience to short selling is a strong indicator that the gold rally is not a tulip bubble. It is a flight of Daedalus. It is the end of an era for the wax out of which fiat currency served to elevate "independent" central bankers. Not only did the short sale fail; the short sail signified for all of Daedalus the end of the American financial ruling elite's control over the manipulation of the precious metals market.\footnote{["Not for the first time, Chinese investors have emerged as a driving force in precious investment trends as gold and silver surge and then slump." \emph{Bloomberg}. February 6th, 2026.]} 
\newline \indent Orchestrated to coincide with several major events simultaneously, JP Morgan Chase's attempt to crash the market of precious metals through a short sale\footnote{After the JP Morgan Chase's failed Stated orchestrated short sale in the precious metals market, the precious metals rebounded almmost immediately. By February 3rd, 2026, gold returned to 5,000 or more dollars. The historic rally in the metals market turned the 2026 Winter Olympics into the most expensive game for medals in the history of mankind. Despite the January 29th, 2026 short sale, spot the rising prices for gold and silver set records for the melt value of the medals; the intrinsic metal value of the podium now stands are 2,250 ollars for the gold metal, 1, 350 for the silver metal, 5 and 45 cents for the bronze metal\footnote{Since bronze is a lesser quality metal than cooper, the third place metal should be made into cooper, one of the most amazing pieces of metal on earth.} With the total number of metals to be distributed, the more than 1, 146 medals cost more than 1 million 350 thousand dollars, the most any set of medals has ever cost the olympic games.} followed the first showing of Melania Trump's film, the heavily redacted release of the Epstein files with images and videos\footnote{The Epstein files apparently result from a historical analogue. The so-called Dutroux affair is the historical analogue. Survivors such as Anneke Lucas describe how the political, economic, or societal ruling elites raped children at masked balls like the ones in Stanley Kubrick's \emph{Eyes Wide Shut} in corrupt scandals like the Dutroux affair. Modeled on the Dutroux affair, international child sex trafficking networks like Epstein's are a matter of course for the borderless lives of the rich and famous. It is indisputable that Epstein executed the supervision of an international child sex trafficking network with the permission of America's ruling elite, especially the police State bureaucracy such as the prosecutors, judges, or Courts.}, the shuttering of the Metropolitan Capital Bank & Trust in Chicago, Illinois, the preparations for an attack on Iran with airpower (See Baudrillard above), and Warsh's appointment.  While rumours fly that soaring gold and silver prices caught major Western bullion banks like MCB&T off guard, fundamentals prevailed. Gold rose to 4, 900 dollars, restoring its losses within hours; the restoration returned gold to January 26th, 2026, indicating that gold managed to acquire the lost amount within hours; some accounts claim the three day gap represented an artifice; Chinese merchants displayed sales for gold at precisely the level at which JP Morgan Chase orchestrated its short sale. The fact that JP Morgan Chase's short sale did not crash gold destroyed the effect the coordination sought to project. Through the coordination of these events simultaneously, Trump sought to project an image of sinister control with a promise for the return of the halcyon days of quantitative easing, bailouts, security from the masses, or continued control over the fundamentals of the U.S. economy, just as the Federal government's response to the 2008 financial crisis provided. The disparity separating the promise from the provision, however, could not be farther from reality. The orchestration of the collapse of the Metropolitan Capital Bank & Trust in Chicago and other banks like MCB&T failed; the idea that a massive sell-off could trigger a lower threshold for these struggling banks to exit the market safely also began to collide with a harsh reality, as several banks already on the chopping block looked ripe for disintegration. Banks like Zions Bancorporation, Regions Financial, Citizens Financial Group, Valley National Bank, Synovus Bank, Umpqua Bank, Old National Bank, or Synchrony Bank\footnote{In a report "Data Analysis: Commercial Real Estate Troubles Threaten U.S. Banks," by \emph{Florida Atlantic University}, published on March 10th, 2025 stated: "Of the 158 largest banks, 59 in the country are facing exposures to commercial real estate greater than 300 percent of their total equity capital, as reported in the fourth quarter 2024 regulatory data and shown by the U.S. Banks’ Exposure to Risk from Commercial Real Estate screener." In an article entitled, "U.S. Banks’ Exposure to Risk from Commercial Real Estate Screener," the \emph{Florida Atlantic University} lists the 59 largest banks in a list with all 158 banks together with a ratio for exposure to risk from commercial real estate compared to equity. The problem equity, however, is that equity does not hold value when the stock market crashes because the currency in which a stock is valued losses its value. Equity is no comparison for hard assets like gold, property, or utilities like water, electricity, or garbage.}


\newline \indent Against the backdrop of rising gold’s ability to withstand short selling at an amount of fluctuation equivalent to or exceeding more than 3.5 trillion dollars, Moscow stiffened its posture. Sergey Lavrov reiterated Moscow's demands for the Ukraine war's end. Vladimir Putin mentioned how the remaining Nord Stream pipe offers a competitiveness to Germany against China. With one out of eight of every car in Europe a Chinese import, the lack of European competitiveness seriously undermines its ability to leverage the strength of its economy against the rise of China's trade surplus. The Russians, especially Sergey Lavrov, know when to hold them, fold them or walk away.  Accordingly, the Russians held their cards at the geopolitical table for poker on eastern Europe close to their vest in a reminder of the Kenny Roger's song called "The Gambler."

% The parabolic move to $5,600 gold and $122 silver was an existential threat. They were facing insolvency. According to a theory about yesterday's epic beatdown, the 10-sigma crash was an engineered event, orchestrated by a consortium of central banks and bullion banks, to allow these failing institutions to cover their short positions at artificially low prices and save the system from a Lehman-style contagion event that would have started in the precious metals market. If this theory is true, it has a profoundly bullish implication: the big, manipulative short sellers are now out of the market. They have been allowed to cover, and the path is now clear for a much more explosive move higher, free from the artificial suppression that has plagued the market for decades. Could it be?

\entry{great powers} {} {} {In the years following the French Revolution in 1789, the regional European powers began to form nation-states with France, the most influential military power in Europe during the Napoleonic war, leading the way. Germany, in its own right, evolved primarily from the Kingdom of Prussia into a unified nation-state through successive acquisitions from the time of Fredrick the Great to the end of the Paris Commune in 1871. In 1871 Germany finally defeated France. These two regional European powers, France and Germany, thus emerged from the Battle of Waterloo on June 18, 1815, the end of the Napoleonic Wars, to fight each other for dominance on the continent well past the 19th century. The Franco-Prussian War (1870-1871), which triggered a seismic shift in Europe's power dynamics. Germany's celebration of its unity in Versailles after the acquisition of the Alsace-Lorraine humiliated France, establishing Germany as Europe's strongest continental power, set the stage for the rivalry that drove these two nation-states to begin World War I in the 20th century. While during the 19th and 20th century a feature for distinguishing a nation-state from a great power became not only the possession of overseas colonies but a great naval fleet. \newline \indent In the 21st century great power competition emerged among the most well armed nuclear powers for access to, control over or exploitation of trade routes, raw materials, rare earths or minerals, or currency, precious metals, or commodities. Countries such as the U.S., Russia, China, France, the United Kingdom, India, Pakistan, North Korea, Israel, and Belarus, whose status is a result of Russia's decision to share its own missiles with the country, remain the world's nuclear armed powers. Alongside these countries, a number of non-nuclear armed regional powers, however, began to earn the status of a great power through the lucrative arms trade. In the production of arms, munitions, infantry fighting vehicles, armored personnel carriers, tanks, howitzers, Panzerhaubitze, one way kamikaze aerial or oceanic drones, heavy weapons such as shoulder fired anti-tank surface-to-air missile, weapon systems, anti-air defense systems, fighters jets, corvettes, frigates, destroyers or air craft carriers, countries have begun to stratify the basis for power in region after region throughout the world. \newline \indent Egypt, for instance, began to develop its defense industrial complex at an alarming rate before the fourth anniversary of the Ukraine war, demonstrating its ability to outclass its not only its Arab neighbors to the west but its Arabic speaking non-ethnically Arab neighbors to the southwest, south, or south east; Egypt's ability to engage in the arms trade at scale has begun to intensify its competition with neighboring powers in the Middle East such as Israel. While neither Egypt nor Israel are able to create fighter jets, Egypt's ability to create a frigate certainly provokes comparison with Israel's naval power, since Israel has a robust fleet with a history of excellence in shipbuilding but crucially without an example for an Israeli built frigate. \newline \indent Before the third anniversary of the Ukraine war, Turkey, another non-nuclear armed nation-state, began to produce the TAI TF Kaan Stealth Fighter, its own fighter jet. Turkey is one of the few countries in the Mediterranean producing its own fleet.\footnote{Türkiye exports its fleet. It delivered to Ukraine two Ada-class corvettes, the Hetman Ivan Mazepa on October 2nd, 2022 and the Hetman Ivan Vyhovskyi on August 1st, 2024. The nation-states capable of exporting units from its own fleet are stronger than those that cannot but produce new units for nothing more than their own fleet.}

A wide spectrum of commentators, analysts, agents, researchers have reported on the Ukraine war; many have reported time and time again without reference to any of Greene's laws; many have reported time and time again on blogs, Telegram channels, in newspapers, or in books but few to any at all have ever thought to deprive the underlying causes of the Ukraine war from an application of Greene's laws. It is almost as though Green's book, celebrated on Instagram by scantly clad women the world over, is irrelevant for the politics of the 21st century. How could such an influential book influence the analyses of the Ukraine war so little? Is it mere coincidence? Is it causality? In what lies the irrelevance of Greene's 48 laws of power? How are Greene's 48 laws of power irrelevant for what is the central, defining, most historically encompassing, greatest political, economic, societal event in the history of the 21st century? The outcome of the Ukraine war decides not only one of the four primary unresolved post-Soviet conflicts in the ever collapsing breakdown of the U.S.S.R. (i.e., in countries such as Transnistria, Nagorno-Karabakh, or Georgia) but the fate of the future of the future redivision of the collapsed Ottoman Empire. Its importance for the United States, Europe, the Middle East, Africa, Russia or Eurasia simply cannot be underestimated.

Hao's thesis is exceptionally flawed. There is no requirement in human history that a person understand fully the thing he or she seeks to create; since Artificial General Intelligence is distinctively not human intelligence but a new kind of intelligence, there is no reason to believe her thesis applies, ipso facto, to deny its creation. The telephone, for instance, is one of the inventions likely no one understood before its creation but this lack of understanding is perhaps what motivated its creation, if not its further development. More importantly, fewer people still understood the telephone after its further development led to its recreation from PSTN (Public Switched Telephone Network), PSDN (Public Switched Data Network), or ISDN (Integrated Services Digital Network). Hao's thesis is therefore inapplicable.\footnote{Human invention is often accidental.

It means that human beings do not necessarily even need to know exactly what they are inventing when they are inventing it so long as they are able to cope with the consequences of the power it wields. The point of invention, however, is not cognition but development, a sudden transformation from one stage to another new, higher, more powerful stage. It therefore requires no prerequisite cognition, let alone a premonition.}

The aim of the program is not to prevent crime but to enforce upon people suspected of future criminal activity a deprivation of rights. Statistically, the program did not result in safer communities with fewer crimes, as the police State bureaucracy induce, commit a great deal or  procure a high number of the crimes in a community. The manual is the first manual in the history of the United States to introduce into a local enforcement the idea of intelligence from the perspective of espionage, spycraft or State secrets where data collection and analysis is churned for insights in a model where the police view fellow citizens as a enemies just like a State views foreign citizens of a target country as enemies.  \newline \indent Crucial to the pivot is September 11th, 2001 where President George Bush oversaw an internal false flag operation, signaling the cresendo in the fourth period of America’s declining superpower (when the Federal debt began to increase in multiples year over year). Repeated in the manual is the theory of “information silos” (i.e., where neither the CIA nor the FBI coordinated activities so the greatest “terrorist” attack on American soil slipped through the cracks)\footnotea{In the era of the algorithmic revolution where communication is instantaneous, the idea that neither the CIA nor the FBI coordinated activities on for identifying, investigating, or tracking the individuals involved in the September 11th, 2001 terrorist attack lacks credability. If so, the fact that the U.S. has so many different layers in its vast police State bureaucracy is more the reason for their dissolution than a justification for failure. } when the manual describes how “the tragic events on 9/11” called “for US law enforcement agencies at all levels to increaseinformation and intelligence sharing. The central program with the manual is the central problem of Ratcliffe’s book. Ratcliffe is not interested in an analysis of the root cause of criminal activity, the vast majority of which the highest levels of government perpetuate (i.e., institutitionalized bribery, money laundering, or quid pro quo schemes), but in a model so efficient for its management that the status quo ante may be sustained.\footnote{Ratcliffe’s crime funnel is agnostic. It does not differentiate crimes or criminal activity. Bribery, money laundering, or quid pro quo schemes, so popular in Washington, D.C., for instance, are hardly comparable to the most frequently occuring crimes like jaywalking. Ratcliffe does not understand crime because he does not understand law. Law falls under multiple definitions but the most commonly associated aim of law is the common good (as Thomas Aquinas (1225-1274) pointed out in the (\emph{Summa Theologiae} (I-II; qq. 90-97) more than 800 years ago). In many cases the laws are either contrary to the common good are designed in a such way that discering whether or not they apply to the common good becomes impossible. Is a ban against fireworks on July 4th an ordinance of reason ordained by he who is charge of the community for the common good? Are these question raised? At least these questions do not enter Ratcliffe’s mind. \newline \indent A problem Aquinas did not address is the scope and scale of laws. The unsustainable exponential rate of growth in the U.S. legal framework recommends its revision. Less than a century ago, all Federal laws fit into a single volume, while now they span 54 volumes in no fewere than 60,000 pages. A series of books over time addressed the exponential growth of the U.S. legal framework. Manning's \emph{Hyperlexis: Law and Disorder} (1970), Dworkin's \emph{Law's Empire} (1986), Howard's \emph{The Death of Common Sense} (1994), Carrington's \emph{The Rule of Lawyers} (1995), Cramton's \emph{Too Much Law?} (2007) have pointed out that America has too many laws that are too complex. Entitled, \emph{Over Ruled: The Human Toll of Too Much Law}, Niel Gorsuch draws together these previous contributions to demonstrate how has begun to destroy the foundations of its democracy with codified overthinking, eliminating common sense, judgement, or plain and simple cognitive, logical, sensible analysis. ["America Has Too Many Laws," \emph{The Atlantic}. August 5th, 2024], ["Have you committed a felony yet? Probably so." \emph{The Washington Post}. August 30th, 2024]  A jewel on the crown of the criqiue of America’s codified overthinking, Gorsuch’s contribution has had surprisingly little to no impact on legislation, prosecution or the Courts. It is as though their recommendations are so much “dust in the wind.” These concerns on law demonstrate how in nearly all spheres of American life, law least of all, the tendency of development is towards self-destruction to a “Point of Know Return.”} It is a stoic response to the crescendo in the fourth period of America’s decline where contraints on budgets compel the adoption of a less costly type of management. The Roman legionnaire tightens his \emph{cingulum militare}. The waist, however, can only condense so much. Ultimately,  the result is a shift in focus. The shift is from the prevention of crime to a focus on “criminals.” The manual states: “ if our criminal justice system is struggling to deal with the 4 people at the bottom of the crimefunnel, wouldn’t it be more prudent for us to identify and ensure we go after the right four people for those spots?” Since the manual does not focus on an analysis of the root cause of crime, the remedy has absolutely nothing to do with a solution.\footnote{The manual even quotes the root cause of criminal activity: “David Farrington has pointed out that our knowledge of offending patterns is such that‘potential offenders can be identified at an early age with a reasonable degree ofaccuracy’ (1990: 105-106). He estimated that the best predictors in 10-year-olds ofhaving a criminal conviction later in life are socio-economic deprivation, antisocialparents and siblings, poor parental supervision and child rearing, coming from brokenhomes, low intelligence and a poor school record. However, many of these variables areunlikely to be available to police departments, so this information has little value froman intelligence-led policing perspective. (Ratcliffe, 2016: 44)” Despite acknowledging the root cause of criminal activity in economic depravity, the manual insist on a remedy without any relation to a solution for economic depravity.} The isolation of individuals thus has no impact on crime, since crime results primarily from economic depravity. Ratcliffe’s project is a failure.\footnote{Described as sounding like a pitch for a Hollywood blockbuster such as Moneyball meets Minority Report, two cities, two of the largest in the country, abandoned algorithmic, AI, data driven approaches. In 2018 the Los Angeles Police Department discontinued an algorithmic, AI, data driven policy for policing before the Department’s Inspector General found that hal of the 637 people in the data had one or no violent-crime arrests. ["Review of Selected Los Angeles Police Department Data-Driven Policing Strategies," Los Angeles Police Commission. \emph{Office of the Inspector Genera} March 12th, 2019], ["LAPD ends another data-driven crime program touted to target violent offenders," \emph{Los Angeles Times}. April 12th, 2019] The Chicago Police Department had its own system to identify people with algorithms, AI, or data but for people likely to be involved in a shooting. Chicago terminated the program in 2019. In 2020 the city Inspector General found the Chicago’s program unfair on the basis of inaccurate data. ["Advisory Concerning the Chicago Police Department's Predictive Risk Models," \emph{Office of Inspector General} for the Chicago Police Department. January 23rd, 2020], ["For years Chicago police rated the risk of tens of thousands being caught up in violence. That controversial effort has quietly been ended." \emph{Chicago Tribune}. January 25th, 2020.] The reports these Inspector Generals published demonstrate how operationalized placement of people in databases for policing leads inevitably to basic, human, civil, Constitutional violations.} \newline \indent Declaring the practice unconstitutional in terms of the First, Fourth and Fourteenth Amendment rights on December 3rd, 2024, a Federal court ordered the Pasco County Sheriff, Chris Nocco, from Pasco, Florida, to discontinue “absolutely and unambiguously the process of designating penons as prolific offenders,” effectivelly terminating the algorithmic, AI, data driven law enforcement tool. Designated \emph{Dalanea Taylor, Tammy Heilaman, Darlene Deegan, and Robert A Jones III v. Chris Nocco}” in the United States District Court of the Middle District of Florida, Tampa Division, under case number 8:21-cv-00555-SDM-CPT, the settlement remains open so that the Court may enforce further the categorical ban on the use of dystopian law enforcement tools in general. \newline \indent Alongside the rise in the use of algorithms, AI, or data to subject citizens to deprivations of First, Fourth, and Fourteenth Amendment rights, the use of technology is driving a rise in the number, type, or manner of pretextual stops. On March 22nd, 2022 a Fusion Data Center, which collates data on the truck, truck’s license plate, insurance, driver, driver’s license, driver’s bank account information, the places where Flock-style license plate scanners spotted the truck or plate scanning devices for tolls, decied that a truck driver’s trip is suspicious. The Fusion Data Center immediately dispatched an officer to interdict the truck driver on the “suspicious” trip. On March 16, 2022, The Bexar County Sheriff, which made no objection to its deployment for the sake of a pretextual stop without probable cause for the underlying request, pursued the “suspect.”  After observing the truck driver proceed down I-35 at the highway’s designated speed limit without incidence, the sheriff alleged that a truck driver swerved over the yellow line. The officer’s dashcam footage, however, demonstrated that the truck driver had not crossed over the line. Despite the Sheriff’s false testimony (which is illegal), the officer proceeded to utilize his false testimony to subject the driver, Alek Schott, to Fusion Data Center’s pretextual stop the anyway. The officer pulled the truck driver over, subjecting him to multiple violations of the law. The incident demonstrates not only the illegality of “pretextual stops” but the role algorithms, AI, or data play in the burgeoning police State bureaucracy’s expansion of anti-Constitutional powers designed to deprive citizens of basic, human, civil, Constitutional rights systematically. \newline \indent In a series of articles published by the \emph{Lincoln Journal Star}, the newspaper exposes how the Department of Homeland Security, whose integrated systems for identifying, tracking, or indicting individuals subject to politically motivated investigations include such algorithmic, AI or data driven platforms of the omnious Palantir, engages in pretextual stops systematically.\footnote{["Loophole lets Seward County seize millions from motorists without convicting them of crimes," \emph{Lincoln Journal Star}. June 24, 2023], ["Forfeiture," \emph{Lincoln Journal Star}. June 25th, 2023], ["Lawmaker seeks to ban practice allowing Seward County, others, to seize millions from motorists," \emph{Lincoln Journal Star} February 4th, 2024]} The Seward County Sheriff’s Office, which made no objection to its deployment for the sake of a pretextual stop without probable cause for the underlying request, has deployed the tactic of Whren\footnote{} stops extensively for civil asset forfeitures, particularly along a 24 mile long stretch of historic Interstate 80, where the SCSO has seized millions of dollars from motorists without an exception to the Fourth Amendment or due process. In a way similar to Bexar County Sheriffs in Texas, the SCSO relies on false testimony to concoct “probable cause” for pretextual stops on vehicles the DHS’ fusion data center have believe may have cash.\footnote{It is clear that in at least one case the system DHS exploits must have accessed a driver’s most recent bank withdrawals.} The execuses for “probable cause” cover a wide range of differentiate prextexts. These are: ‘following too closely,’ 'dim headlights,' 'lane changes,' 'tailgating,' 'width of license plate frame’,  “no turn signal,” “driving with phone,” etc… Based on the data, there is no question that the DHS’s deployment of the SCSO is a Federal conspiracy to deprive motorists of basic, human, civil, Constitutional rights. In Seward County, the population is 17, 962 people; more than a third of all cases of this kind in Nebraska originate from Seward County. Seward county has accumulated more than  7.5 million dollars in forfeited cash in the past five years. During that time, the SCSO bought stun guns and bulletproof vests “ Seward and Milford Police Departments, a sheriff’s cruiser and an 18,000 drone for the Nebraska State Patrol. It recently spent 15,000 on two ballistic shields after the school shooting in Uvalde, Texas.” It is clear that the money SCSO acquired serves no purpose than to ingratiate the office. While the newspaper published these articles well before Palantir announced the beginning of its integration with the Department of Homeland Security for deploying Immigration Customs and Emigration officers to Minneapolis, Minnesota, readers can easily infer from the newspaper’s reporting how only an algorithmic, AI, data driven program like a Fusion Data Center could be behind the selection of Seward County’s targets in Nebraska.

\entry{insider trading} {} {} {During the Ukraine war, the Trump administration sought to sign into law a bill restricting "insider trading" for Congressmen.\footnote{The original bill only applied to lawmakers; it was co-sponsored by Sen. Bernie Moreno, R-Ohio. The bill was originally titled the “PELOSI Act,” a reference to past accusations by Republicans that former Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., whose benefit from inside information in stock trading not only increased the wealth in her portfolio but provided the insider with an opportunity to influence Pelosi's decision making in Congress directly. The actual title of the bill is S.1879 - Ban Congressional Stock Trading Act. Who is former Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif.? She is a heinous psychopath whom members of the left wing of the State security apparatus call 'mama bear,' a nickname that epitomizes the psychopathy at the heart of the left wing of the State security apparatus. In his own articles on Pelosi, David North spares no compliment. Having served in the House since 1987 for California's 11th congressional district, most of San Francisco, Calif., Pelosi's history of legislature in the House of Representatives reveals a surprising lack of distinction in its dearth of reform. Has Nancy Pelosi ever passed legislate to improve San Francisco, California or America?} The law is not just a stupid charade designed to temper the Democrats against the Republicans; it is not a "marvelous state of the art tactic."\footnote{In a long lost collection of political pinups from the 1980s, \emph{Hardball}, Chris Matthews, a contemporary Machiavellian politician, enunciates how "[behind] those vaunted closed doors lies not only the paraphernalia of power but a distinctive language. It is a world of tough old alliances, Gothic revenge and crafty deal-making, but also of marvelous state-of-the-art tactics such as spin and positioning." Matthews' Washington lexicon is among the most colorful for political pundits but he suffers from false consciousness; his belief that Trump's January 6th attack on capital hill was not a Federal conspiracy orchestrated by America's State security apparatus undermines his lack of clear depth on American politics.} It is far more sinister. It is nothing more than a new instrument for the police State bureaucracy\footnote{The U.S. is not an exemplar of organic solidarity. It is thus legitimate to suppose that from time to time the police State bureaucracy in the U.S. may or may not align with a Presidential Administration.} to exert control over Congressmen, since the bill subjects Congressmen to Federal criminal prosecution. A congressman who is accused of "insider trading" after an investigation may, nonetheless, escape Federal criminal prosecution, should the Federal government's Attorney General decide not to file charges at all; after all Federal criminal prosecution is but a selective, non-compulsory, discretionary process anyway.  Even the threat of an investigation into a Congress member's "insider trading," however, would be enough to exert control over a Congressman. There is the crux of the matter. Since the Attorney General is under the direct authority of the President, a Presidential Administration could therefore blackmail a Congress person engaged in "insider trading" (inadvertently or on purpose) with the threat of an investigation or even criminal charges.\footnote{The trend during the past few decades, however, has been for Democrats to file charges against Republicans or vice versa so that the promise of a pardon at the changing of the guard guarantees a party's power over the party member. It is a sinister way to whip American politicians, the vast majority of whom are engaged in one or another form of corruption, into submission.} Trump's bill thus effectively provides the Federal government's Executive Branch with more influence over Congressmen than any previous bill, thereby tipping the scales in the system of checks and balances.  \newline \indent Directed at controlling rather than regulating the influence of 'special interest' on Congressmen, special interest thus nonetheless remains. A special interest may, for instance, bribe an Executive Branch's Presidential Administration to permit a Congressman's "insider trading." Should the bill pass, special interest would thereafter be required to conduct the business of insider trading through the Executive Branch rather than directly through individual members of Congress. Trump's bill merely reroutes the path of least resistance from Congressman or Congresswoman to the Executive Branch. Neither members of Congress nor special interest escapes the Executive Branch; either way the Executive Branch benefits from Trump's bill. \newline \indent While insider trading must certainly be the subject of regulation, there are two problems with the so-called PELOSI Act; the first is, as mentioned, the expansion of the Executive Branch's control over members of Congress; the second is its prevarication\footnote{The PELOSI Act is even more problematic, if you consider a blind trust to be problematic; a blind trust is a legal arrangement that gives a trustee control over your money and property without your knowledge or input. A possible workaround could easily be to refer the insider to trustee's law firm. The insider could coordinate insider trading with the trustee's law firm, since the language of the PELOSI Act covers the relationship a prospective trustee of a Member of Congress' blind trust is so broad as to exempt a trustee's law firm; if the trustee himself or herself has no personal knowledge of an interested party obtaining knowledge of any trust property other than the initial property of the qualified blind trust, then the trustee cannot be subject to enforcement. Given the complicated nature of the more than five requirements for \textsection 13162.(f)(3)(A-E), no Member of Congress is likely to submit the required notice on his or her own but through a lawyer. Should the noticing lawyer be involved, his or her law firm could easily contact the trustee's law firm to coordinate insider trading; therefore neither the noticing lawyer nor the trustee would have personal knowledge of the insider trading. It is clear from  loopholes like these that the PELOSI Act is neither a stupid charade nor a "marvelous state of the art tactic" but a bill carefully crafted to ensare the American public in a vile deception of reform.}; the PELOSI Act solves nothing; it merely shifts power over insider trading from members of Congress to the Executive Branch without a solution for the root case of the problem of special interests. \newline \indent A truly effective way to regulate special interest would relate to none of the three branches of the Federal government, all of which have become totally subordinate to the will of a thin layer of America's richest oligarchs, but to the electoral system itself. The fact that campaign finance remains largely unregulated undermines the central principle of equality in American elections. A candidate, whose ability to raise more money than his or her competitors guarantees his or her election, simply bypasses his or her constituent electorate altogether. If a new electoral system were to limit campaign finance to a low threshold with a requirement for candidates to engage in seven four hour long debates live streamed on the Internet from locations throughout a city, a county, a state or the nation, elections might reach a level of engagement on par with Abraham Lincoln's debates with Stephen Douglas from 1858. A candidate would never be able to simply bypass his constituent electorate. \newline \indent In 1858, Lincoln confronted Douglas before large audiences in seven places throughout Illinois for several hours: in Ottawa on August 21, in Freeport on August 27, in Jonesboro on September 15, in Charleston on September 18, in Galesburg on October 7, in Quincy on October 13, and in Alton on October 15. The newspapers covering these debates not only republished these debates but provided analyses. So important were these debates that Lincoln felt the need to memorialize them in a book. \newline \indent America's current debates, including the one now raging over the PELOSI Act (which ignores most of the important issues), are not worth the paper they are printed on but a series of seven debates in a new electoral system with campaign finance limited to a low threshold would marginalize whatever money a special interest might like to utilize for bypassing the electorate.\footnote{A special interest could still attach itself to a candidate but in the form of pledges. If a special interest's candidate wins, the special interest could realize its pledge. These pledges could be designed to sponsor a public work project such as building a library, endowing a university with scholarships, improving a park, or completing a project aimed at the common good. The vast majority of the money special interest spends on American elections in the current system is swamped, wasted, spent down the drain, on the election itself rather than on the electing community. Advertisements, for instance, are an excellent example; an advertisement for a candidate in an election loses its relevance for a community after voting; it contributes almost nothing to the community's common good, being biased, prejudiced or partial. A pledge, however, has the advantage of outliving an election. A tendency for skinflint must replace America's propensity for spendthrift in elections, lest the country continue to waste money on what are arguably elections rigged by America's State security apparatus. The election of U.S. Representative, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, for New York's 14th congressional district on June 26, 2018, for instance, resulted from an election engineered carefully to ensure its outcome; the Democratic Socialist of America (DSA), the New York chapter of which Ocasio-Cortez represented, is an instrument of the Federal Bureau of Investigation so America's State security apparatus rigged that election. Confirmation of its status as an instrument of the Federal Bureau of Investigation comes in the form of the denunciations the Socialist Equality Party, a more sinister instrument of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, made against AOC.  Similarly, Zohran Mamdani, a member of the New York chapter of the DSA, won an engineered election in 2025 during the Ukraine war to become New York's mayor. If elections in America like Ocasio-Cortez's and Mamdani's are already rigged by its State security apparatus, the money spent during an election would be better invested in the community than in campaigns. After the campaigns matter less for competition between candidates than for the presentation of a facade of democracy. Isn't it a bit extravagant to spend millions of dollars on a facade of democracy?} It would turn the election away from special interests towards the electorate. It would level the playing field. It would further democratize America's republican system. It would make America great again.}

\entry{Jefferson, Thomas} {} {} {Undoubtedly the greatest revolutionary in the War of Independence, a potent theoretician of American doctrine of revolution, an unparalleled Statesman compared to his unbelievably accomplished contemporaries, a walking, talking, writing reflection of the world historic coalescence of the Renaissance with the Enlightenment in the Americas, the single most important founding father of the United States of America, a superseding proponent of the U.S. Constitution's Bill of Rights, a firmly empowered proselyte of sagacious, reasonable, Ancient Greek democracy the Western tradition celebrates from time immemorial, Thomas Jefferson is the single most American American in the country's history. No American has ever been more American than Thomas Jefferson. \newline \indent No one embodied the English Enlightenment more than Jefferson and his affinity with and affection for John Locke and his works shines through Jefferson's work light In his \emph{Treatise on Government}, Locke advocated strongly for the natural rights of individuals; Locke's justification for the Glorious Revolution rested on Parliament's enactment of a Bill of Rights in 1689; the Bill of Rights provided that the king could not suspend a law\footnote{A modern practice the Nazi jurist Carl Schmidt elaborates in his theory of the sovereign, a principle like so many others the U.S. exploits like a feather in its cap or an arrow in its quiver to annihilate the basis for American power in the U.S. Constitution. These suspensions are largely due to billionaires; groups of billionaires, for instance, meet to orchestrate acts of tyranny. The police State bureaucracy's brutal crackdown on the anti-Netanyahu protests at Columbia University in 2023, for instance, is exposed in an article. In the article, the author claims a group of American billionaires bribed the mayor of New York City to request local law enforcement, whose authority the police unions control throughout the U.S., to raise the protest. The suspension of the right to assemble is thereby clearly demonstrated; further proof of its suspension is that in the subsequently filed criminal complaints against the students, the prosecutors entered dismissals on the record without trial. These subsequently filed criminal complaints are manifestations of malicious prosecution, demonstrating how the underlying act precipitating the false arrests stemmed primarily from a suspension of the right to assemble.}, nor could he raise taxes or raise and maintain an army without Parliament's consent and it further forbade the Kind from arresting subjects and detaining them without due process. Locke's justification for the Glorious Revolution rested on his belief that the natural rights of a small segment of the population-the landed classes-could not allow by their status as landowners the King to enter upon these transgressions so they act as a check on an imbalance of power. Together with Hobbes, Locke believed man leaves the state of nature by means of a social contract whereby the consent of the governed is the only permissions a government may enjoy for its continued existence. Locke specifically asserted that a government retains the consent of the people so long as it fulfills the duty of protecting the people's natural rights. If it failed to do so, the government would not only lose the consent of the governed but its legitimacy; the people would then be justified in abolishing their government through overthrow, if necessary, or by other means and instituting a new one. Jefferson embraced these ideas; Jefferson's provision in the Declaration of Independence form 1776, for instance, reflects Locke's thinking on government.\footnote{Jefferson wrote: "We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights, that among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. That, to secure these rights, governments are instituted among men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed. That, whenever any form of government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the right of the people to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new government, laying its foundation on such principles, and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their safety and happiness."} Jefferson and the American revolution embodied Locke's ideas from the second treatise on government and in some cases carry his language directly from the treatise into the \emph{Declaration}. While "most Americans had absorbed Locke's works as a kind of political gospel; and the \emph{Declaration} in its form, in its phraseology, follows closely certain sentences in Locke's second treatise on government,"\footnote{Becker, Carl. \emph{The Declaration of Independence: A Study in the History of Political Ideas}. (New York: Vintage Books, 1922), pg. 27} Jefferson embodied these ideas more closely than other Americans and contemporary American revolutionaries to such an extent that "Locke dominates American political thought" in Jefferson's works, as "no thinker anywhere dominates the political thought of a nation." Locke is so prevalent that he is a "massive national cliché."\footnote{Hartz, Louis. \emph{The Liberal Tradition in America: An Interpretation of American Political Thought Since the Revolution} (New York: Harcourt, Brace and World, Inc., 1955), pg. 140.} \newline \indent In his characteristic clairvoyance, Jefferson is one of the primary leading American advocates against central banking during the Revolution in much the same way that he did against slavery.\footnote{The two issues Jefferson never managed to advance to fruition during his lifetime are the two issues missing from the U.S. Constitution and the Declaration of Independence-prohibitions on slavery and private central banking against government control over the issuance of currency. In the case of the Declaration of Independence, members of the Continental Congress prevented Jefferson from floating a passage against slavery; in terms of } Although he witnessed Hamilton, whose death in a duel may be celebrated as a great moment in American history, twice succeed with a charter for a central bank, first with the Bank of North America (1781), second with the The First Bank of America (1791), under the tutelage of Robert Morris, Jefferson fought against the establishment of a central back. In fact, he pronounced upon the American people a deeply ominous premonition when he said: "If the American people ever allow private banks to control the issue of their currency, first by inflation, then by deflation, the banks and the corporations which grow up around them will deprive the people of all property until their children wake up homeless on the continent their fathers conquered." Jefferson even believed in an amendment designed to prohibit a private owned central bank in America. He wrote: "I wish it were possible to obtain a single amendment to our Constitution taking form the federal government their power of borrowing."\footnote{ In a letter to John Taylor on November 26, 1798, Thomas Jefferson wrote the statement in relation to war: "I wish it were possible to obtain a single amendment to our constitution; I would be willing to depend on that alone for the reduction of the administration of our government to the genuine principles of it’s constitution; I mean an additional article taking from the federal government the power of borrowing. I now deny their power of making paper money or any thing else a legal tender. I know that to pay all proper expenses within the year would, in case of war, be hard on us. but not so hard as ten wars instead of one. for wars would be reduced in that proportion. besides that the state governments would be free to lend their credit in borrowing quotas." \emph{PTJ}, 30:589.}

H. Allen and Co., 13, Waterloo Place, Pall Mall. S.W., is a comprehensive encyclopedia that covers the doctrines, rites, ceremonies, and customs of the Islamic faith, along with technical and theological terms, Semitic analyses of religious cognates in Hebrew and Arabic, important for understanding the Abrahamic faiths. The dictionary methodically outlines the five pillars of Islam (i.e., Shahada (the declaration of faith), Salah (prayer), Zakat (charity), Sawm (fasting during Ramadan), and Hajj (pilgrimage to Mecca)), focusing primarily on the Sunni sect, while noting from time to time how significant distinctions from Shiah or Wahhabi perspectives are prominent and distinguished in belief and practice.

Along these lines, Hughes most notable work on the religion itself is \emph{Notes on Muhammadanism Being Outlines of the Religious System of Islam}. Hughes work is therefore one of the most important contributions to the study of Arabic outside of Arab inhabited land in North Africa, the Middle Eastern, the Levatine, the Fertile Crescent, or the Arabian Peninsula.

\entry{Knuth, Donald} {} {} {Before the beginning of the AI revolution, algorithms dominated the curiosity of people interested in computer science. In one of the greatest books yet written on the subject of algorithms called "The Art of Computer Programming" (TAOCP), Donald Knuth famously announced how "[the] best way to communicate from one human being to another is through a story."\footnote{"The Computer Scientist Who Can't Stop Telling Stories". \emph{Quanta Magazine}.  April 19, 2020.} Knuth's book spans no fewer than four volumes over more than three decades of publishing. There are seven fascicles for the fourth volume alone. Volume 1 (Fundamental Algorithms) is published in 1997, Volume 2 (Seminumerical Algorithms) in 1997, Volume 3 (Sorting and Searching) in 1998, Volume 4A (Combinatorial Algorithms) in 2011, Volume 4B (Combinatorial Algorithms) in 2022, Volume 4 with Fascicle 1 (Bitwise Tricks and Techniques, Binary Decisim Diagrams) in 2009, Volume 4 with Fascicle 2 (Generating All Tuples and Permutations) in 2005, Volume 4 with Fascicle 3 (Generating All Combinations and Partitions) in 2005, Volume V with Fascicle 4 (Generating All Trees-History of Combinatorial Generation) in 2006, Volume 4 Fascicle 5 with (Mathematical Preliminaries Redux, Backtracking, Dancing, Links) in  2018, Volume 4 Fascicle 6 (Satisfiability) in 2015, Volume 4 with Fascicle 7 (Constraint Satisfaction) in 2025. Knuth's emphasis on the idea that programming is less a science than an art turns the idea of computer science on its head. Called "the father of the analysis of algorithms,"\footnote{Karp, Richard M. (February 1986). "Combinatorics, Complexity, and Randomness". Communications of the ACM. 29 (2): 98–109. doi:10.1145/5657.5658} Knuth's work into algorithms, the design of programs to decide how to achieve an objective through the performance of a specific series of tasks in the shortest possible period of time with the least amount of resources, is a seminal work in the 21st century.\footnote{Knuth is also important for an altogether different reason. Knuth is responsible for creating the \LaTeX  program responsible for the typesetting of the present work. It is one of the many conveniences for which an entire generation of students, doctorates, researchers or scholars are indebted the world over, as the the \LaTeX  program is one of the cheapest, easiest, most elegant ways to typeset a book for self-publication in the history of the world.} It is not so much that Knuth's book is a radical departure from the analysis, pedagogy, or design of algorithms. It is that his book, written by a single author, brings together the various thoughts on algorithms into a single compilation, much in the same way that Euclid's \emph{Elements} organized the achievements of geometers like Pythagorus into a single book. Therein lies his contribution. \newline \indent Knuth's ability to produce a four volume book with a fourth volume containing no fewer than seven fascicles is more a result of his obedience to the ruling elite than his own abilities. Knuth, for instance, has been able to enjoy years of tenure at Stanford without the interference, interruptions, or disruptions that the search for new employment causes when members of America's police state bureaucracy swoops down on dissidents like vultures to deprive him or her of life, liberty or the pursuit of happiness in acts designed to embody the anti-Constitutional spirit of the anti-American regime.\footnote{ Can a graduate student without stability produce a volume work on a single subject over the course of more than three decades? Hundreds of thousands of American graduate students, especially women, are subjected years of prolonged periods of time without a position, stable employment, a research assistantship, stipend, scholarship, or grant, the basic prerequisite for the expressed development of human faculties over time. The interference, interruptions, or disruptions are designed to stymie intellectual development in the United States so that even the ability to express thought becomes subject to the police state bureaucracy's myriad levers of control. The employment of the United Auto Workers' union in the United States, which is one of the many levers at its disposal, actively seeks to ensure that graduate students are not only imprisoned in a prism of control but can escape only at the expense of their entire career in academia. The ruling elite, who employ the lowest levels of the Lumpenproletariat in the ranks of the UAW, are happy to watch aspiring graduate students sink below the level their intellectual promise suggests they reach. It is but one of the many ways the police State bureaucracy in the United States undermines its own people.}}

\entry{Latin} {} {} {A language whose integration into the American curricula for primary school used to be inseparable from the Western tradition is now no longer taught in schools so as to separate Americans not only from the the Holy Roman Church but the history of great ideas articulated in the language from its inception to its disintegration. \newline \indent The problem has manifested itself in a number of ways. \newline \indent The minute that the Western world abandoned Caesar's \emph{Commentario de Bello Gallico}, Latin textbooks lost their focus.\footnote{In the preface to \emph{Viri Romae Illustres} from 1894, the author writes of a "growing sentiment among teachers of Latin in secondary schools that Caesar's Commentaries furnish Latin uninteresting for pupils" for first year Latin students. The Committee of the Ten wrote: "Our American schools are probable the only ones in the world of which this is true. The book is altogether too difficult for beginners; it is too exclusively military in contents to be generally interesting; its vocabularly is too largely restricted, from the nature of the subject, to marches, sieges, and battles, to afford the best introduction to subsequent reading; and, finally, it touches human life at too few points to be morally helpful and significant." These sentiments are value judgements about literature; they have almost nothing to do with the language itself. The Committee of Ten's decision to promote \emph{Viri Romae Illustres} entailed a process of fragmentation that would lead inevitably to the type of fragmentation which is now all arage in academia for eclecticism, randomness, or a complete lack of focus. The idea that Caesar's text is too hard for students is belied by Caesar's wordstock. Caesar's \emph{Commentario de Bello Gallico} contains no more than 2,190 words; it is three thousand less than the amount required for fluency in any given language. Caesar's \emph{Commentario de Bello Gallico} thus represented a surmountable barrier of entry for early language learners.} Wheelock's great Latin textbook, for instance, is but one of the manifestations the Western world's abandoned Latin language has produced. Wheelock's latin has produced multiple editions but the book has lost the singular focus that its predecessor textbooks maintained. In Latin textbooks before the rise of Wheelock's, Latin textbooks taught a vocabularly with a purpose. The purpose of that vocabularly focused almost exclusively on the wordstock required to read Caesar's \emph{Commentario de Bello Gallico}. Wheelock's Latin has absolutely no purpose so rather than focusing on an ability like being able to read a book, the text focuses on grammar. At one minute the text introduces students to a few lines from Cicero, at another from Ovid; the text is all over the place; students expecting to read works from any one of these figures from start to finish seals his or her fate by the end of Wheelock's textbook. It dissolves the study of the language into an exercise for abstract concepts such as the various ways scholars have come to describe the person (persōna), number (numerus), tense (tempus), mood (modus) or voice (vōx) but these are less an experience of language than a study of grammar. A language's grammar, however, useless without its usefulness. The shift away from Caesar shifted Latin learners away from the language, culture, history or people of the Western tradition to grammar. It is not hard to understand that only a short time after Wheelock's classic Latin textbook appeared in 1956, the language has been marginalized to the lowest type of minor for undergraduates in academia. It has all but disappeared from curricula. A revivification of Latin thus requires a renaissance in the history of Latin learning.}

These are "Mob and Riot Control" (1964), "Watts: Riot or Revolt?" (1965), etc... But "Riot Makers" represents a breakthrough in the divulgence of its political ideology.} an investigation into the cause of so-called racial disturbances on campuses during the 1960s hardly makes any mention of the fact that at time of the so-called riots the U.S. continued to conduct a fruitless, destructive, wasteful, illegal war against Vietnam without a reasonable justification for the slaughter. Providing a timeline of what the film makers call "major riots" following the 1964 Harlem unrest, the film is an obvious attempt to cover the Federal government's complicity in the assassination of the great Martin Luther King Jr.'s death in 1968, the death of man whose initial journey began with protests against racial inequities but ended with calls for social equality, the true motive and motivation for the Federal government's decision to murder the greatest speech maker of the 20th century. \newline \indent While the film makers attempt to set aside both social as well as economic causes for the outburst of social discontent, the film's true objective is to assassinate multiple characters with a single clip from a long reel of film. The film labels figures like Abbie Hoffman, Rennie Davis, or Tom Hayden\footnote{} as purveyors of a new type of trained agitators called "Leninoids" after Vladimir Iliych Lenin.\footnote{The accusation actually more undermines Lenin, whose objective in his book \emph{What is to be Done?} is not to create new protest leaders but anchor the working class struggle firmly within the center of orthodox Marxist theory by combining the hierarchical transformation of the Great German General Staff's organization principle for theoretical militancy with a modern 20th century political party, than sheds light on these nameless political figures.} It had absolutely nothing to do with riots. While the film makers claim the American Leftist movement had its roots not just in the Soviet Union but in Hitler's Germany, the film presents little to no evidence of these claims. It claims "each provocateur was a 'graduate engineer in social demolition,' the techniques the film makers attribute to these riot makers (which is a fairly accurate assessment of their political activity) are precisely the ones agencies like the Federal Bureau of Investigation used against dissidents throughout the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s, as detailed in numerous books on its Cointelpro\footnote{FBI Director Hoover's general COINTELPRO (COunter INTELligence PROgram) directive intentionally trained agents to "expose, disrupt, misdirect, discredit, or otherwise neutralize" the activities or leadership of the working class movements they infiltrated with the aim of preventing workers from 1) exercising any rights such as those enumerated in the Bill of Rights, 2) exerting any influence over the politics of the state, or 3) in any way "exposing, disrupting, misdirecting, discrediting, or otherwise neutralizing" the activities of the Federal government's insistence on maintaining authoritarianism at any or all costs. 3) The emphasis on maintaining a monopoly on violence is simply not enough; violence, however gentle or harsh, has never been enough for the execution of the Hooverites; it must focus on the preservation of the highest order of authoritarianism so that the State never returns to a democratic Republic led by representatives elected by the population in any shape, size, or form but remains firmly within the hands of those most committed to securing the preclusion of any political party differing from the one the Democrats form with the Republicans together with the suppression of any voice opposed to the status quo ante. 4) The COINTELPRO program unleashes the gates of hell, anything Dante Alighieri could envision to be the basis for eternal condemnation to one of his lowest circles in hell, to guarantee the usurpation of the direction, development, or constitution of objective consciousness so that workers, whom the FBI's agent chain to the wall of a cave, see nothing but shadows on the wall.\footnote{"Their riotmaking methods follow a time-tested formula and the results are as predictable as what happens when the chemist drops drops a block of sodium in water and creates an explosion," the FBI narrator says. Spoken as though from a legal framework, the FBI's narrator continues, describing how there are three elements in "riot making."  "First," he says, is "the putting together of an organization and deploying workers where they can be the most effective." Secondly, is "getting the masses of people ready and in the right frame of mind to riot." Last but not least, he leaves no doubt to his purpose when he mentions the "riot itself." While in the 1960s, 1970s, or 1980s documentaries like "The Riot Makers," might have informed candidates, now these documentaries instruct agents on how to adopt the Riot Makers' tactics for inducing workers to fail, just as Noam Chomsky's \emph{Manufactured Consent}, once a critique suddenly became a playbook for agents. The trend among modern day anti-Constitutional agents of the State has been "to flip the script" on critics, rabble-rousers, radicals, or revolution so that the subversion of a revolutionary struggle becomes a means by which the State not only deprives citizens of basic, human, civil, or Constitutional rights but perpetuates its rule over society no matter how far the rulers of that society disintegrate the millennia of social gains working people without the means of production have fought to preserve, from Magna Carta to the remnants of the Civil War, from the American revolution to the French Revolution, from the Paris Commune of 1871 to the Bolshevik revolution.} Light must be shut out with darkness completely so that no worker escapes the degradation of consciousness that keeps him or her chained to the wall.} campaigns to smash alternative news media.

His definition of a riot is a direct attack on the Bill of Rights' right to assemble, designed to denigrate an American's right to exercise his or her right to nothing more than anarchism.

\entry{Light} {} {} {In one of the future developments of the Ukraine war, fiber optic drones, which are less susceptible to Directed Energy Weapons, High Powered Microwaves, or Electro-Magnetic Pulses, are expected to undergo a further transformation with the incorporation of light into the various components responsible for its flight. These components, mostly onboard electronics which are currently subject to disruption from a DEW, EMP or HPM, are expected to be designed with light. \newline \indent Light offers notable advantages not merely beyond immunity to these types of weapons. In terms of its ability to program realities in mathematics, light is capable of being configured to exhibit the properties theorized in group theory. For instance, passing light through a clear lens can serve as the unit; black lens as null; various other lenses as functions. \newline \indent  If light is a manifestation of the same phenomena as electricity, the binary principle of denoting a sequence of hexadecimal numbers with bits may be just as photonic as electric. If the mathematical rules for representing mixtures of colored light can be represented with photonics, these may exceed the spectrum of the binary principle. A mixture of light would allow for a new type of computer logic to develop. It would allow for intermediary states. In his treatise on \emph{Electricity and Magnetism} from 1873, James Clark Maxwell\footnote{A grand statue of Maxwell in the city of Edinburgh, Scotland, his birthplace, with a wooden dowel composed of the three primary colors from his famous experiment in his hand.}, one of the greatest post-Enlightenment scholars of physics before Einstein, describes light as governed by the same phenomena that govern electricity and magnetism, unifying these concepts in his equations.A central processing unit whose cores are based on light rather than electricity will significantly enhance not only the speed but the power of computation. Since light is governed by the same phenomena as electricity (i.e., light is an electromagnetic wave), light should be able to provide for a more complex type of computing beyond the electrified binary principle because light may not only emulate but mock electricity with its myriad number of states. A computer is nothing more than a state machine. If the number of states can be expanded beyond ones or zeros to colors from light, the state machine would exceed the electrified binary principle. Since red, green, and blue are primary lights, the three different lights can represent three different states with mixtures of the lights being intermediary states so programmed. These mixtures can, in turn, serve as functions for groups, rings, or fields manifested with a complex of light than with ones or zeros. It is really easy to imagine how the properties of groups may be represented in terms of Maxwell's theory of light. \newline \indent Not based on a flashing beam of light triggering a one or a zero as the present day design for photonic processors dictates, CPUs designed with a Maxwellian photonic core (MPC) are expected to exceed the power of intermediary states in the superpositions of cubits from quantum computing. The present type of flashing beam of light ignores the fact that Maxwell proved light to be composed of primary colors, whose differentiation, rather than a flashing beam of light, is the basis for intermediary states.  
\newline \indent Let us suppose, for instance, that an equation for the set of colors resulting from operations on the three primary colors is the following: c ≡ xR + yG + zB, where c, the color resulting from the operation, R, G, B, standing for the three primary colors (Red, Green, Blue), with the amount of these primary colors designated by the corresponding lower case letters, x, y, z (i.e., the ratio of its illumination\footnote{James Clark Maxwell demonstrates in section 3, equations 1 through 5, "the ratio of its illumination" in the famous article the Royal Society of London published in 1860. (pp. 62-63)} ), records the result of the operations. The lower case letters, a, b, c, are thus the measure of c. In terms of the set of all the possible colors of c, we shall designated that set by the capital letter, C so that all colors c so resulting from the operations on the three primary colors shall be therein contained. It thus follows from Maxwell's explanations that the behavior of the set of colors C are algebraic. Namely, the set C displays the properties of a group. We shall enumerate the properties. (C, *) is a group, since associativity holds for R * (G * B) = (R * G) * B for all R, G, B in the set C; moreover, there exists an identity element e of C such that R * e = e * R for all R of C; for any R, G, B there exists a color a to the negative 1 of C such that a * a to the negative 1 equals a to the negative 1 * a equals the identity element. Since (C, *) holds for R * G equals G * R for all R, G of C, the set of colors is an abelian group (i.e., a commutative group). 
\newline \indent It is absurd to have faith in the idea that quantum computing spells the end of cryptography, since quantum computing would give rise to quantum cryptography. The whole idea of cryptography, however, is paranoia. The information States hold secret are hardly ever so recondite that open source analysis cannot uncover a hint. If an archaeologist is able to imagine the reconstruction of an unknown dinosaur from a single bone fragment,\footnote{Another example is that human analysis can deduce the tools an artist utilizes for his or her artwork. The Hockney Falco thesis, for instance, claims that 16th century painting relied on either concave mirrors or refractive lenses to project the images of objects illuminated by sunlight onto his board/canvas. In the BBC's documentary on the Hockney Falco thesis, a picture Lorenzo Lotto, an Italian Renaissance painter, draughtsman, and illustrator, traditionally placed in the Venetian school, painted is displayed. [Hockney, David. \emph{David Hockney's Secret Knowledge.} Directed by Randall Wright, BBC, 2002.] In 1545 painting called, "Portrait Of A Married Couple," the tablecloth loses focus as the viewer's eye travels from the edge to the center of the table, from foreground to background (i.e., a depth of field problem where the scale of the one no longer matches that of the latter). American experimental physicist, Charles M. Falco, an expert on the magnetic and optical properties of thin film material, derived the information necessary for determining not only the type but the focal length and diameter of the lense Lorenzo Lotto exploited for his rendition of tablecloth from the application of geometry to measurements he took on the disparities separating the foreground to the background to demonstrate that the painter likely did not paint from the mind's eye but a lense. While the theory is an excellent example of constructive imaginative realism (i.e., the ability to construction what must be based on what is), the Hockney-Falco thesis is only partially correct as no one, painters least of all, looks at anything exclusively through a lense; the lense is merely an instrument for the enhancement of an object already in view, meaning that an artists sees his object before magnification. The Hockney-Falco thesis, however, may be easily integrated into contemporary AI algorithms to enhance the ability of AI both to recognize as well as to apply the principles of optics and geometry to analyze and generate images.} a hint obtained from open source analysis can easily reveal the entirety of a secret.

\entry{Lithium} {} {} {During the Ukraine war, lithium, white gold as it is called, became one of the elements great powers around the world began to covet. According to Soviet analysts from the early days of the successful Bolshevik revolution, which had absolutely nothing to do with an unsuccessful Rothschild conspiracy to implant private central banks into Czarist Russia\footnote{}, the Ukraine is not only the breadbasket of Europe but a historical site playing host to a hotbed of bloody contest over one of Europe's most prized sources of raw materials. During the Ukraine war, Russia itself captured no fewer than two of Ukraine's most important lithium mines; these are the Shevchenko lithium deposit in the Pokrovsk direction (January 11th, 2025) and the Kruta Balka in the Zaporizhzhia Oblast (2022). As a result, Russia's capture of these mines, Western analysts argue, "[disrupts] progress toward leveraging Ukraine's lithium reserves to support Europe's strategic autonomy in critical minerals."\footnote{["Russia Takes Control of Ukrainian Lithium Mines," \emph{OilPrice}. January 14th, 2025]} Within the context of the Ukraine war, lithium thus raises important questions about how a country relates to raw materials. What is "strategic autonomy"? Is "strategic autonomy" the prerequisite for great power? Is the lack of strategic autonomy an indication of a weak power? Is the objective for "strategic autonomy" power? Is the objective independence? Is "independence" a subordinate feature of "strategic autonomy" such that a strategically autonomous country is, ipso facto, independent? Is it possible for a country to be truly independent?\footnote{Is a country like Aristotle's political animal. A country without a dependence upon another is either a god or a beast.}\newline \indent The idea of "Europe's strategic autonomy in critical minerals" underscores the dilemma inherent in the political form of nation and state in a globalized economy. It is an oxymoron for Europe to invoke the idea of autonomy in the European Union where the union presides over the confederated states in jurisprudence, politics, economy, or, a derivate therefore, currency. If even imaginable, Europe's "autonomy" would mean but dependence for a competing continent like Eurasia, Africa, North America, or South America. It is clear from Russia's dependence on a mine in Chile how even the capture of two deposits of lithium ore in Eastern Europe cannot emancipate Russia from its integration into the world economy. While Russia's own newspapers derided Ukrainians with the loss of the Shevchenko lithium deposit, the "gigantic problem" is not the loss of access to, control over, or exploitation of this or that mine but the realization that no matter how hard a nation state strives, none may escape of the ties of mutual dependence.  \newline \indent In South America Chile's\footnote{On Monday January 5th, 2025 the website from the U.S. Department of State displayed a blank page for a hyperlink to an announcement on the declassified daily briefs President Nixon received during Pinochet's military coup d'stat against the democratically elected socialist President Salvador Allende on September 11th, 1973. The first reference to these declassified documents, two of President Nixon's daily briefs from September 8th, 1973 and September 11th, 1973, is in a Russian article published by \textrussian{РБК} on August 26th, 2023 under the title, \textrussian{США рассекретили документы о госперевороте в Чили в 1973 году}. It is well established throughout the literature on Chile that the CIA paid Pinochet to overthrow Allende in a \textfrench{coup d'état} so the removal is a forbidding reminder of the severe consequences the application of a modern Monroe Doctrine in the age of a great power rivalry focused on minerals, rare earths or coveted elements.} large mine in the Atacama Desert played host to the rivalry during the first year of the Ukraine war. In response to the Ukraine war, Albemarle Corporation, the company in charge of the mine, suspended operations in Chile, forbidding deliveries of products or technology to Russia.\footnote{ According to the Spanish daily, \emph{La Tercera}, Russia purchased a majority stake in the mine on April 13th, 2022. ["Wealth Minerals firma acuerdo con filial de rusa Rosatom para proyecto de litio en Chile," \emph{La Tercera}.] In 2022, an article the news agency published described how Russia acknowledged the "gigantic" problem the ban of exports to Russia would cause. In the article, Vladislav Demidov is quoted as saying, "en Rusia no hay extracción de mineral de litio. El mineral lo recibimos en forma de carbonato de litio de Chile, Argentina, China y Bolivia. El problema con el litio ya es gigantesco ya que en caso de que se produzca una negativa a suministrar mineral por parte de Bolivia, no tendríamos de donde sacarlo”.  The newspaper further reported how "[la] interrupción de los envios de litio procedentes de dichos países puede tener consequencias muy graves para Rusia." ["Rusia reconoce problema gigantesco por cese de envíos de litio de Chile y Argentina," \emph{La Tercera}. April 13th, 2022]} The disruption to Russia's supply of lithium from Chile demonstrates how contracted supply chains for the extraction of critical minerals or elements became tightened\footnote{Just as Russia itself sought its own mine for the extract of lithium during the second anniversary of the Ukraine war (in part due to the loss of the Chilean mine), the United States embarked on its own exploration for uranium during the third anniversary when the U.S. Department of Energy announced on January 5th, 2026 its intention to mine uranium in the country in a campaign called "Unleashing American Energy Dominance." "\textrussian{В 2022-м Аргентина и Чили приостановили поставки литиевого сырья в Россию. Через год «Норникель» вместе с «Росатомом» создали совместное предприятие «Полярный литий»}. The new company, \textrussian{«Полярный литий»}, aims to extract lithium from the \textrussian{Колмозерское месторождение литиевых руд}. The company plans to extract no less than 2 million tonnes of lithium ore, carbonate, and hydroxide in an effort to compete with the top three countries leading lithium production: Australia (86 thousand tonnes a year), Chile (44 thousand tonnes), China (33 thousand tonnes). ["Металл для энергоперехода: сможет ли Россия обеспечить себя литием," \textrussian{\emph{РБК}}, November 27th, 2024]} in the face of the Ukraine war,\footnote{During the second anniversary of the Ukraine war, ENAMI (La Empresa Nacional de Minería) announced a competition, offering six companies the opportunity to compete for a stake in three more Chilean deserts filled with lithium: La Isla, Aguilar and  Grande. The six companies became BYD Chile (China), CNGR Advanced Material (China), LG Energy Solution (South Korea), Eramet Chile (France), Posco Holdings (South Korea) and Rio Tinto Mining and Exploration Limited (English-Australian). ENAMI announced the winner in March, the third anniversary of the Ukraine war (2025). France Eramet won the contract. Within the context of France's contract, the question of "strategic autonomy" for Europe arises again. Does France's acquisition of a contract for a lithium mine in Chile make Europe, ipso facto, strategically autonomous? Does not France's dependence upon Chile dissolve the fantasy of independence? Is not France now dependent upon Chile for its lithium? If France's dependence relies on Chile, Europe's own is several degrees more severe than France's. In what sense does the political form of nation and state achieve independence in a globalized economy? Is not France's acquisition of the mine the chagrin of the losers? Are not the countries without access to the mine doubly, triply, quadruply more dependent upon the Franco-Chilean mining relation than before France became the prize winner?} just as the United State began conveniently to revive the Monroe Doctrine from its military history in the region when in 1898 the U.S. conquered almost the entire Pacific.\footnote{The revivification of the Monroe Doctrine corresponded well with U.S. sanctions on Russia in South America for the Ukraine war.}

No weapon has wielded more power on the battlefield than the Magura, since no weapon has accomplished what the Magura has accomplished. In the aftermath of Bakhmut-Artemovsk, the Ukrainians lost complete control over the Black Sea. Shortly after losing control, the Ukrainians fought their way back by constantly iterating on the Magura drone, improving specific features until Russia lost more than half of its Black Sea Fleet, withdrawing the remainder to the port city of Novorossisk in Russia, far away from the Ukrainian Magura drones. The Magura drones represented one of the most sophisticated threats to sea vessels in the history of warfare. The Magura's ability to strike larger, more expensive, time-consuming constructions like ships such as corvettes, frigates, destroyers, etc... represents the essence of the drone threat, the ability to cause an enemy such irreplaceable loss that its restoration, several times the cost of the drone, takes more time than is feasible for its effect to impact the outcome of the war.

\entry{Manhattan} {} {} {Qinghai is a province in China where the Talatan solar project is constructed. With enough power to provide energy to every household in Chicago, the project boasts 16,930 megawatts. During the Ukraine war, it continued to expand. In fact, it is still expanding, adding panels with a target of growing to 10 times the area of Manhattan in three years.\footnote{["Why China Built 162 Square Miles of Solar Panels on the World’s Highest Plateau," \emph{New York Times}, October 30th, 2025.]} Another 4,700 megawatts of wind energy and 7,380 megawatts of hydroelectric dams are nearby. Manhattan is useful benchmark. In contrast to China, America, whose inability to build large scale infrastructure projects is optimized in California's more than two decades on a rail project without a single line of track, builds data centers without solar projects. While data centers are expected to account for 8 percent of all U.S. power by 2030, America's insistence on leveraging the existing electricity, which is in a downward death spiral, for improving AI leaves little reason to have faith in its ability. Meta's planned 5-GW data center in Richland Parish, Louisiana, known as Hyperion, for instance, is expected to ultimately exceed the size and energy demands of just lower Manhattan alone. It is easy to see that in a situation where the Chinese are expected to generate three times the size of Manhattan with the Talatan solar project, America has no plan but to add to a decrepit electricity grid an additional data center less than the full-size of Manhattan.\footnote{[The Architects of AI Are TIME’s 2025 Person of the Year," \emph{Time}, December 11th, 2025].}}

Describing the situation in Russia after the United States sanctioned Lukoil and Rosneft on October 22, 2025, Steve Rosenberg, the BBC's Russia correspondent, posted a tweet to X with a video on November 17th, 2025.\footnote{[\@BBCSteveR:1990481916949062026]} In the video Rosenberg displays the inner page of a famous Russian tabloid, \textrussian{Московский Комсомолец}, with a picture of mannequins, stripped, bare naked, save the leggings. Above the picture of the mannequins is a title that reads: \textrussian{Без Одежки Протягивай Ножки}. Below the title, the subtitle reads: \textrussian{В России закрылся каждый второй магазин одежды и обуви}. The cover of the newspaper derides the Russian tourism industry for trying to sell a trip to the Taiga for the price of a Turkish holiday. \newline \indent The crescendo, however, comes not from the mannequins but from a critique of Russia's \textrussian{гиперинфляция штрафных санкций}. Rosenberg reads the following lines: \textrussian{Скорее всего о проблеме дефицита госбюджета на судебных процессах представители обвинения рассказывать все-таки не будут. Однако понятно, что дело, похоже, как раз в этом. Вместе с тем если решать оперативную задачу повысить содержание золота в яйцах, которая, очевидно, имеет несколько вариантов решения, путем фактического уничтожения дающих эти яйца куриц, то это, как представляется, так себе государственная политика.} These lines, discussing what are hardly statistics or hard numbers, illustrate how sanctions have begun to harden Russia's domestic policies.}

\entry{Manstein, Erich von, the 2nd Conquerer of Sevastopol} {} {} {Since neither a Roman nor a n Ottoman commander captured the Cimmeria before Prince Grigory Aleksandrovich Potemkin-Tauricheski, Erich von Manstein, the Nazi general, became the 2nd Conquerer of Sevastopol after the city fell on July 4th, 1942. History, however, may call the general the first conquerer, since Manstein is the first to conquer the city, established by Catherine the Great, after its Russification into a naval fortress to assert her Empire's control over the Black Sea. \newline \indent Manstein conquered the Cimmeria with his personal dedication to one of the underlying principles of Blitzkrieg. He observed how the battle, which had raged for the better part of a year, began to tip the scales in the Nazi's favor.\footnote{During World War II, the U.S. Army's Military Intelligence Service initiated a series of reports on the Axis' powers. Among these reports is one dedicated to \emph{The German Armored Army}. The author expounds on the core tactical doctrine of German armor, explaining how "both from a tactical as well as from a strategical point of view, the selection of the maneuver to be carried out must always be inspired by the desire to disconcert the enemy command through its very boldness and rapidity. If necessary, 'what seems most improbable must be accomplished at the improbable place,' as remarked an officer of the staff of the 1st Armored Division in justification of the maneuver at Sedan." The author continues, stating: "By spectacular and even horrible combat methods, one must annihilate any will to resist on the part of the enemy. The fury of the "Stukas," the whizzing of their bombs, the din of their machine guns, the onrush of the tanks, the thunder of their march and of their fire, the spurt of the flames from the flame throwers, the explosion of melanin charges, everything must be brought into play to affect the morale of the combatant and give him the impression of an "apocalyptic" scene." Published on August 10th, 1942, Special Series \textnumero{ 2} is one of the U.S. Army's first explications of the Nazi's lightening warfare. What is fascinating about the term is just how flexibly its composition rendered absolutely new concepts to the German lexicon. In a depiction of the unbelievably expurgated cartography of Nazi campaigns from a book published in 1942 in \textgerman{Mǔnchen}, Germany, under the title, \textgerman{Der Krieg in Karten: 1939/1941}, the word \emph{Blitzsieg} comes to define the outcome of the battle over the Balkans from April 6th to the 30th, 1941 for the editor, Giselher Wirsing. Under the title, "\textgerman{Der Blitzsieg auf dem Balkan}" (pg. 24), an abstract depicts a lightening victory "\emph{aus dem Handgelenk heraus}." The German word victory, \emph{Sieg}, rhymes with war, \emph{Krieg}, indicating how the flexible nature of the German language accorded with dynamic concepts of German warfare, easily creating new terms.} At precisely the moment when the scales began to weigh more heavily on the Nazis's side than the Soviets', Manstein commanded elements of his 11th Army to make the improbable possible with a cross-channel raid on Severnaya Bay where the Soviets estimated the chances for a successful attack to be highly improbable. In a reverberation of Manstein's sense for the appropriate place at the most opportune time like his modification of \emph{Fall Gelb}'s plan to pass through the Ardennes on May 10th, 1940, Manstein's correct appreciation for Napoleon's advice to maneuver according to circumstance prevailed.\footnote{It stands to mention that one of the unmentioned principles of \emph{Blitzkrieg} is harmony. In the Special Series \textnumero{ 2}, the author emphasizes how "it would be an error to compare one weapon with another. Far from encouraging rivalry among the various weapons, the new organization has developed their \underline{harmonious} association, and utilizes the motor to give them previously unrealized possibilities of speed. Armored weapons (light or heavy), infantry, artillery, engineers, signal communications, not to mention the air forces-all these arms contribute to the common aim: overcoming the adversary by an irresistible assault, followed by a complete destruction." \newline \indent Over the years, Sevastopol witnessed fewer conquerers than Jerusalem, the famous center of the world.}

\entry{MK Ultra} {} {} {The exposure of MK Ultra hardly scratches the surface of the Central Intelligence Agency's anti-American activities. Even though Seymour Hersh's journalism prior to MK Ultra resulted in a denounciation of the CIA's illegal activities on domestic American soil, the CIA persisted.\footnote{Seymour Hersh's early journalism into the Federal government's deployment of the CIA against anti-Vietnam protesters resulted in the exposure of Operation Chaos. Operation Chaos sought to catalogue the identity of anti-Vietnam protesters so that the Federal government could target these Americans for retaliation. Despite Seymour Hersh's exposure of Operation Chaos, the CIA continued on American soil with MK Ultra.} The CIA is not permitted to operate, conduct, or engage in operations on Americans on American soil. It is against the law. The National Security Act of 1947, for instance, prohibits the agency from conducting domestic surveillance or law enforcement activities against U.S. citizens on American soil. Designed to protect civil liberties, the law clearly separates foreign intelligence from domestic law enforcement.  \newline \indent Revealed in 1979 when an ABC News "Close Up" program, a type of programming that ran from 1973 to 1988, aired a three-part report with reporter Paul Altmeyer called "Mission: Mind Control," the program revealed a secret CIA program launched in the 1950's in which thousands of subjects were given experimental doses of LSD called the MK Ultra Project.\footnote{The first two parts of the report are easily accessible; the third part is apparently missing.} The MK Ultra Project became a 30 year search for perfect mind control where the aim of the program "controlling an individual to the point where he will do our bidding against his will or against the instinct of self-preservation.” Although Paul Altmeyer makes no mention of the National Security Act of 1947, his report on the MK Ultra Project provides more than enough information to recommend the conclusion that the CIA paid little to no attention to American law, let alone the National Security Act of 1947.\newline \indent Many outrageous revelations arise from Paul Altmeyer's report. Among the most outrageous revelations in the report is an admission by one of the leaders of MK Ultra that the CIA placed doses of LSD into the water supply of a city so as to induce specific behaviors in the citypeople.\footnote{The admission that the CIA poisoned a city's water supply bears contemporary relevance for the Federal government's deployment of Immigration and Custom's Enforcement agents to the State of Minnesota. Could the Federal government have poisoned the water supply in Minnesota with drugs designed to induce the loss of inhibition so that ICE officers would clash more frequently with the State's residents than they would, had their water supply not been poisoned? Is the loss of inhibition in the State's residents a behavior the Federal government has sought to induce for an experiment designed to discern the limits of crowd control by classes of law enforcement like ICE during a crisis? What could the impending crisis be?}\newline \indent The report details how the MK Ultra experiments represent not just a bold, foolhardy, senseless loss of American taxpayer money on illegal activites but a reflection of a profound personal crisis with the objective of intelligence in the agency. Despite the prevalance of an alleged nuclear threat from the spread of communism, for which the Truman's foreign policy of Containment could have easily legitimized investigation, the agency abandoned research into communists for a preoccupation with dilletante's addiction for practical psychology, a pimp's manpower over women, or an obsession on drugs the most addicted narcotics officers could probably have never rivaled in usage, discovery, or sales. The conclusion one must reach from the MK Ultra is that the CIA is not an intelligence agency ready to plunge into the depths of the obscure, mystic or esoteric sources of knowledge "to protest America or Americans" but an aimless source of funding for Americans whose life no longer holds any meaning but for entertainment from boredom or midlife crises.\footnote{George White, a white, Ivy League, middle class cavalier psychopath without a conscience capable of questioning the ultimate aim of his escapades, epitomizes the CIA's lack of soul searching. Retired to Stintson Beach, California, he summarized his career in a letter to his supervisor at the CIA shortly before his death, writing: "It was fun, fun, fun;  Where else could a red blooded American boy, lie, kill and cheat, steal, deceive, rape, and pillage with the sanction and blessing of the All Highest."}

The newspaper details nearly every aspect of the Russian military from the first publication to the last.  It contains an unparalleled wealth of information on geopolitics. One of the themes the newspaper addresses in a series of articles spread across its years of publication is the rise of China against the fall of the United States.\footnote{}

Military Industrial Courier takes its place among these newspapers. \newline \indent A history of its publication with the number of editions following their year runs from 2004 to 2022, totalling more than 900 editions over a little less than 20 years  2004 (\textnumero{} 1 - 50), 2005 (\textnumero{} 1 - 49), 2006 (\textnumero{} 1 - 50), 2007 (\textnumero{} 1 - 50), 2008 (\textnumero{} 1 - 50), 2009 (\textnumero{} 1 - 50), 2010 (\textnumero{} 1 - 50), 2011 (\textnumero{} 1 - 51), 2010 (\textnumero{} 1 - 50), 2012 (\textnumero{} 1 - 51), 2013 (\textnumero{} 1 - 50), 2014 (\textnumero{} 1 - 48), 2015 (\textnumero{} 1 - 49), 2016 (\textnumero{} 1 - 49), 2017 (\textnumero{} 1 - 49), 2018 (\textnumero{} 1 - 50), 2019 (\textnumero{} 1 - 50), 2020 (\textnumero{} 1 - 50), 2021 (\textnumero{} 1 - 50), 2022 (\textnumero{} 1 - 11).

The website where the newspaper published its editions began to throw a 404 error only a short time later.The Military Industrial Courier is no longer available online. Copies of the newspapers are extremely hard to procure. Only a few of the greatest collectors maintain archives.

The transition, especially from the Military Industrial Courier to channels of information such as Rybar's, makes the process for compiling archives of information important for the 21st century a level of difficulty higher than previously imagined. The new process relies on Telegram channels, websites, or social media posts on X; these are incomparably more complex than .pdf copies of editions of a single newspaper like the Military Industrial Courier. The transition thus makes for a less complete, more fragmented archive.

\entry{The Minimalist Program} {} {} {Developed by Noam Chomsky in his last iteration of his system of generative grammar, the Minimalist Program is one of the most fascinating curiosities ever developed in the scientific study of language. In the wake of its immediate debut, a number of linguists leveled important critiques against the program, the most famous of which Shalom Lappin wrote in 1997.\footnote{Johnson, D., Lappin, S. A Critique of the Minimalist Program. \emph{Linguistics and Philosophy} 20, 273–333 (1997). \cite{https://doi.org/10.1023/A:1005328611460} Lappin's critique signified the end of the days when large telecommunication companies like AT\&T, Bell Laboratories, or the IBM T.J. Watson Research Center employed Ph.D. graduates to conduct research into the study of subjects related to communication, representing the end of an era in America's history of telecommunications. Neither AT\&T nor Bell Laboratories continue to employ Ph.D. graduates. It is a shame, since the practice produced great work like Lappin's critique of the Minimalist Program.} Chomsky, who intolerantly refuses to respond in kind to critiques, has simply ignored Lappin's critique for the better part of three decades, demonstrating how academia is less about the emendation of the intellect, reason, or Enlightenment than about the preservation of powerful, ideologically aligned, irrationally committed groups of scholars who are ready to champion a leader's framework than subject that framework to the rigors the framework itself requires in its application to its subject of study. \newline \indent The problem the Minimalist Program faces is similar to the problem the greatest contributors to the study of being face at the end of the Renaissance. The inherent assumption that grammar is innate is akin to that of Descartes' in his famous statement: \emph{cogito, ergo sum}. AI, however, obliterates Chomsky's Cartesian dualism\footnote{A celebration of Chomsky's Cartesian dualism is the auditorium at Eindhoven, the Dutch Republic of Letters, where Noam Chomsky debated the famous French philosopher, Michel Foucault on October 22nd, 1971 at 7:30 p.m. The Eindhoven University of Technology's auditorium, the host states in the documentary of the debate, contains glass, "the inner and outer world blended together." He explains how during the broadcast, unique to modernity for its audacity, "you could see traffic outside passing by. Symbolic, indeed," the host says, "because the relationship between inner and outer world is central to the first half of the fourth philosophers debate about human nature and the ideal society." During the debate, Foucault espouses a fully Cartesian point of view when he separates human thought from the history of ideas, as though people haven't ever had any ideas, or, at least, no one who could think hasn't thought without them. Foucault, the narrator says, does not associate "the history of thought ... with the history of ideas or even the development of the mind, but rather it should be understood as discontinuous transformations," as though an Epicurean atom in Lucretius struck another suddenly giving rise to the advent of a new structure in society but without the underlying forces of nature drawing one electronegative atom to another in a bond like water. Foucault's discontinuous transformations transition "from one network to another." \newline \indent In the debate over the individual, however, the narrator raises a question for these Cartesian dualists, the likes of which is relevant to the 21st century. He asks: "To what extent is the individual able to discover something new - and, if so, how should we make sense of this?" The question is point, since humanity rather than any individual, despite reports to the contrary, has uncovered a huge treasure in the form of Artificial Intelligence. The discovery of Artificial Intelligence, hardly on the minds of these two interlocutors at the time of the debate, is not "something new" an individual can discover by himself or herself but the product of a massive transformation not only in humanity itself but in human society. The productive forces, the likes of which have not been higher than they are now, have come together after an arduous series of trials and errors to produce a consortium of different products (such as the computer, Alternating Current) coordinated to supply mankind with the one thing it champions for its distinction from animality: reason. To the extent that the systems for Artificial Intelligence such as the competitors have created have sought nothing but reason, the ability to discover something new such as AI is a human endeavor. It is not the result of Alan Turing's "Computing Machinery and Intelligence," a paper published before the creation of Large Language Models, but humanity's. If humanity is responsible for AI, then the implications for Cartesian dualism, for Descartes' own \emph{Cogito, ergo sum} could not be any less significant then as now. In terms of humanity's achievement, the \emph{Time} magazine, which is interested less in truth than propaganda, has assembled as list called "The Architects of AI" for 2025 where the list focuses on the people America's ruling elite have selected to deliver messages about AI than about the actual truthfulness of its generation. (i.e., December 11th, 2025) The magazine shamelessly omits the hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of working class developers whose keystrokes, software, problem solving skills, or eight hours of work per day held the entirety of the Magnificent Seven on their backs like the Titan celebrated for holding up the heavens, Atlas. \newline \indent Foucault's critique of the history of science is therefore a supremely ominous forecast of the Platonic state of man, especially now for AI. Foucault says: "Within the traditional history of science, the creativity of individuals has been accorded maximum importance. The history of science up until recently essentially consisted of showing how an individual, whether it was Newton or Mendell, had been the creator rather than discoverer of reality that was already existing in things and in the world, a reality that no other person had previously discovered. I believe the postulate that lies at the core of the traditional history of science is that truth exists in order to be known. Yet the human mind, due to the effect of a number of inhibitions or obstacles, has not managed to see this truth. The mind is made to see the truth and a contingent obstacle is impeding him to see it." Foucault's explanation is thus a modern reiteration of Socrate's Allegory of the Cave from Plato's \emph{Republic}. (514a-520a, Book VII) While he has a different explanation for the different type of chains holding the uninitiated at the bottom of the cave, Foucault's emphasis on the sun's light draws him back to Ancient Greece.} with the production of grammatically sound sentences. It should be that a new program based on the idea that language reaches its unity within society rather than individual speakers giving rise to a greater reflection of the nature of speech and reality. In program where speakers are but a part of a whole, the reduction of a speaker's grammar such as a Spanish speaker's developing intuitions for English grammar naturally clash with those of native English speakers, whose speech is subject to the societies in which he or she is most active. The new program for an examination of grammar rests on setting Chomsky's own minimalist program up against itself so that the historical residues of a language like the English's use of Latin neuter nouns continues to impose the Latin case system on English in much the same way that the Germanic monosyllabic English verbs, all of which are irregular with an unpredictable stem vowel change, still exert influence over English verbs. Setting up individual grammars up against each other such as a Spanish speaker's developing intuitions for English grammar against those of a specific community will bring put the Minimalist Program into motion.}

\entry{mite, a} {} {} {In his beautifully crafted long essay, \emph{Pensees}, Blaise Pascal has the following to say about a mite\footnote{Is Pascal's remark about a mite at all related to a line from Surah Al-Baqarah Ayat 26 in the Holy Quran?}: "But to show him another prodigy equally astonishing, let him examine the most delicate things he knows. Let a mite be given him, with its minute body and parts incomparably more minute, limbs with their joints, veins in the limbs, blood in the veins, humours in the blood, drops in the humours, vapours in the drops. Dividing these last things again, let him exhaust his powers of conception, and let the last object at which he can arrive be now that of our discourse. Perhaps he will think that here is the smallest point in nature. I will let him see therein a new abyss. I will paint for him not only the visible universe, but all that he can conceive of nature’s immensity in the womb of this abridged atom. Let him see therein an infinity of universes, each of which has its firmament, its planets, its earth, in the same proportion as in the visible world; in each earth animals, and in the last mites, in which he will find again all that the first had, finding still in these others the same thing without end and without cessation. Let him lose himself in wonders as amazing in their littleness as the others in their vastness. For who will not be astounded at the fact that our body, which a little while ago was imperceptible in the universe, itself imperceptible in the bosom of the whole, is now a colossus, a world, or rather a whole, in respect of the nothingness which we cannot reach? He who regards himself in this light will be afraid of himself, and observing himself sustained in the body given him by nature between those two abysses of the Infinite and Nothing, will tremble at the sight of these marvels; and I think that, as his curiosity changes into admiration, he will be more disposed to contemplate them in silence than to examine them with presumption."}

\entry{Nadler, Steven} {} {} {Steven Nadler is a biographer of Baruch Spinoza (1672), a great expositor of his life, times in the Dutch Republic of Letters, and philosophy during the Enlightenment.\footnote{During the second anniversary of the Ukraine war, Jonathan Israel published his own biography of Baruch Spinoa. Published on September 25th, 2023, \emph{Spinoza, Life, and Legacy} added to the recent biographies on the philosopher.} Spinoza describes man thus: "In man, in the form of man, in his person, Nature itself thinks, and not at all some special substance, source, or principle instilled into it from outside."
}

% "Even pantheistic philosophy is a religion of space: the Supreme Being is thought to be the infinite space. \emph{Deus sive natura} has extension, or space, as its attribute, not time; time to Spinoza is merely an accident of motion, a mode of thinking. And his desire to develope a philosophy \emph{more geometrico}, in the manner of geometry, which is the science of space, is significant of his space-mindedness." (Heschel, 1951) In contrast with Spinoza, Heschel's condemnation of space resembles Dubord's description of life's commodification. Debord argues that the history of social life can be understood as "the decline of being into having, and having into merely appearing." [Debord (1967) thesis 17] This condition, according to Debord, is the "historical moment at which the commodity completes its colonization of social life." In Heschel's view, the commodification of space where the celebration of time, experience, or being together is subordinated to forms of space (i.e., property) transforms a life worship away from being to having.


\entry{Namibia} {} {} {\newline \indent Nambia, the site of two of the largest sources of highly coveted uranium, is fast becoming one of Africa's flashpoints in the struggle for access to, control over, or exploitation of the yellow metal. Both majority owned by the Chinese, the Husab and \textgerman{Rössing} provide China with profits from or a large, consistent, steady supply of uranium, uranium oxide, or uranium based products.\newline \indent Husab is the world's largest open-pit uranium operation. the third largest uranium producer globally, Husab's ownership structure differs from \textgerman{Rössing}. Nine tenths of the mine belong to Husab Swakop Uranium (Pty) Ltd. China's General Nuclear (CGN) owns HSU. Responsible for no less than 54 percent of China's nuclear power with 28 nuclear reactors generating 33 gigawatts, CGN's interest in the extracts of uranium oxide from Husab is primarily for domestic Chinese consumption. One of the richest uranium assets on Earth, \emph{The Extractor} claims Husab is the world's second largest uranium mine, "producing 3,300 tonnes of uranium and contributing around 7 percent of global output - trailing only Canada's Cigar Lake." (July 25th, 2025) \newline \indent \textgerman{Rössing}, an open-pit uranium mine, is the largest of its kind in the world for area; with a spread at 180 square kilometers, the mine utilizes no more than 20 kilometers for mining, waste disposal, or processing. Located in the Namib Desert near the town of Arandis, 70 kilometers from Swakopmund, the mine is the longest running in the country. In 2019, Cina’s National Uranium Corporation acquired the majority shareholding in \textgerman{Rössing} Uranium. Published in 2024, the company's \emph{Sustainability and Performance Report} provides statistics on production. In 2022, \textgerman{Rössing} Uranium mined approximate 2, 205 tonnes of uranium; increasing output the next year, \textgerman{Rössing} produced 2, 462 tonnes. Undisclosed amounts produced for the second and third anniversaries of the Ukraine war underscore the rising importance Chinese mines in Africa have in light of the shifting balances of power. In 2022, \textgerman{Rössing} Uranium extracted 2,920 metrics tonnes of uranium oxide, compared to 2,659 metric tonnes in 2022, indicating a significant increase in production. Computed in Namibia’s dollar, the company earned 4.84 billion Namibian dollars in 2022 but topped that amount in 2023 with 6.48 billion in 2023, demonstrating a nearly two billion Namibian dollar increase.\footnote{A residual benefit the Chinese reap from its harvest of uranium in Namibia is the ability to provide graduate students, post-graduate students, scientists, researchers, or university adjuncts, professors or tenured professors direct access to the mines for further study. A recent example is an article entitled, "Uranium and U-Bearing minerals in the Husab uranium deposit in Namibia: Occurrence, composition, age, and implications for uranium mineralization process." Published in Volume 182 of \emph{Ore Geology Reviews} during July, 2025, the article not only reaffirms Chinese expertise in geology but expands that knowledge substantially with its analysis of uranium in the Husab uranium deposit. The Chinese are thus able to produce academic studies, transforming the mine from an open-pit into a research center. Chinese research from mines like \textgerman{Rössing} in Namibia not only advance Chinese geology, mining, or mining technology for its mines; it raises China’s global academic profile, adding more publications to its name. \textgerman{Rössing} therefore demonstrates how the Chinese not only mine mines for the yellow metal but for insights, knowledge, or understanding.} Distinguished from Husab, \textgerman{Rössing} is serviced almost exclusively by freight. While the mine relies chiefly upon Toyota and Komatsu (i.e., Japan) for its light and heavy equipment, TransNamib, which specializes in the transportation of bulk and containerized freight, serves the mine, demonstrating China’s not only in mines but in its logistics, a byproduct of China’s long-term strategy for logistics in Africa with rail for its Silk Road. TransNamib transport uranium by sea. \newline \indent In response to the rising awareness the scarcity and rising demand and amid skyrocketing prices from and the challenging requirements for a global supply chain the Ukraine war brought to uranium and its price, both mines reached significant milestones during the war’s first anniversary (2023). In 2023, \textgerman{Rössing} announced plans to extend its operations well into 2036, demonstrating China’s long-term strategy for mineral extraction off the south-eastern coast of Africa. In an event, Husab Uranium celebrated its 10th anniversary, marking over a decade of operations. The event highlighted its contributions to the local economy in Namibia’s Erongo region; important for the development of Sino-Namibian relations, the event is significant not just for Sino-Namibian relations but also for Chinese relations in Africa on the whole; other countries in Africa view a successful venture in another with equal or rising optimism for opportunities. During the third anniversary of the Ukraine war, the combined total of these two mines produced no fewer than 5, 600 tonnes of uranium. This milestone marked Namibia’s emergence as one of the most significant global uranium exporters in a world now seething with competition among great powers for access to, control over or exploitation of the yellow metal.}

\entry{North, David} {} {} {A genius with a mark distinction in history, politics and economics, an eloquent orator, David North, the long time leader of the Socialist Equality party, is a master of deceit, an undercover agent like no other in the history of domestic espionage, responsible for the transformation of the Federal Bureau of Investigation from merely an anti-Communist agency directing actions against communists supected of ties to the U.S.S.R. into an conspiratorial agency with full control over public opinions unacceptable to modern American authoritarianism. Deployed initially as an agent of the Fourth International, whose entire history from Leon Trotsky's death to the present is a history of the agency's infiltration,\footnote{Since the National Security Act of 1947 is de facto inapplicable to the Central Intelligence Agency, the FBI is indistinguishable from the CIA for an external observer. The Trotskyist movement plays host to agents from both or more of the Federal government's agencies. The Socialist Equality Party's own early documents, many of which have silently disappeared from the WSWS, detailed how a CIA agent led the party leadership prior to North's ascension to power. While the exact trajectory would require several hundreds of pages to flesh out, the pattern is predictable. The ascension of a new agent follows the new agent's denunciation of the old's agent's agency so that the new agent's denunciation legitimizes not only his ascension but provides a cover for his or her own affiliation with the denounced agency. It is a brilliant scheme. While North contrived many brilliant schemes, he inherited the denunciated ascension.}, David's North contributions to Marxism, even though he is an agent, are unmistakably valuable to the Trotskyist movement.\newline \indent The works he produced before his last treatise on the Zionist genocide\footnote{Neither Israel itself nor Israelis can be held responsible for Netanyahu's decision to decimate the Gaza Strip not merely on a factual basis but from the perspective of Marxism. North's analysis is not a Marxist analysis; a Marxist analysis requires the application of class; the working class, for instance, cannot be held responsible for an atrocity the Israeli ruling elite committed. North's decision to attribute the Zionist genocie to the State of Israel thus represents a fundamental break with his outstanding previous work in the field of Marxist analysis.} are contributions to the study of Marxism in the 21st century. While the political context of these works is extremely complicated due to North's employment by an agency of the Federal government, these may be divided into three categories.\footnote{One might claim that North's decison to launch the Socialist Equality Party's or the predecessor Workers' Leagure's newspaper on the Internet through the WSWS may have been an important contribution to Marxism. North himself exaggerates the decision's importance. While the publication is certainly important, the idea became so widespread in the late 90s that had North never sought to publish on the Internet a fellow member of the party or else a supporter, enthusiast, or Marxian write would most certainly have.} The first is North's defense of Leon Trotsky against the so-called post-Soviet school of historical falsification. The second is North's defense of Marxism against the post-modern critique of Marx by Adorno. The third is North's exposition of the breakdown of the capitalist crisis leading up, on, or after the 2008 collapse of Lehman Brothers. While the political context for these three categories differs wildly, the reason these categories of contributions are still valuable is twofold; the first is that these are orthodox critiques; the second is that an advanced member of the working class firmly grounded in the history, politics, or economics of Marx has the intellectual power to advance past North's contributions to objective consciousness.\footnote{The problem with the second reason is that the agency's aim for North's employment is not to inspire objective consciousness but to accomplish a number of important goals simultaneously. The agency seeks to establish a monopoly on Trotsky so that no competing political party may usurp the power North's Trotskyist party wields. The second is to provide the simbulance of opposition; the authenticity of North's contributions attack prospective members, whose life is then registered into a database under a secret protocol the Federal government maintains to quell opposition to the policies North's SEP gaslight; the secre protocol is like the FBI's COINTELPRO or the CIA's Operation Chaos; the secret protocol subjects the prospective member to total police State surveillance (emph{henceforth} TPSS) so that he or she never manages to assume leadership of North's SEP or the Fourth International, while a secondary motive is to provide a psuedo legal basis for a vast money laundering conspiracy that pays for architecture, training, or saleries of agents responsible for the TPSS. The third objective is to sell information about prospective members to foreign governments, even those non-allied, unfriendly, inimical governments with one or more foreign policy the U.S. rejects, denounces, seeks to alter or abolish, in accordance with a globally agreed upon protocol among the ruling elite to prevent the expansion of international rivalry into uncontrollable warfare. While the authenticity of the contributions contradictions the agency's aims, its exploitation provides a number of benefits, not the least of which its effect on the ruse.}  It must be said that in the years prior to North's ascension, the last major contributors to Marxism were only those with a personal knowledge of Trotsky such as Max Shachtman, Trotsky's translator for \emph{The Russian Revolution}. North's contributions thus represented the first major, orthodox, post-Trotsky Marxian contributions, despite North's entanglement with the State. Lenin predicted North's entanglement with the State in his book, \emph{Imperialism, the Last Stage of Capitalism}. He explained how the profits yielded from the processes of concentration under imperialism empower businessmen with the ability to brive native politicians, labour leaders or the labour aristocracy (the upper stratum of the working class) into submission so that the labour serves to subvert rather than execute a worker revolution.\footnote{[Bowles, Paul.(2007) \emph{Capitalism}, Pearson: London. pp. 91–93]} While Lenin's explanation of capital preceded the major events in private central banking, the likes of which even Trotsky failed to analyze in detail in his criqitue of America in the foreward to Marx's \emph{Das Kapital}\footnote{A survey of translations available during 19th century Russia made on information related to private central banking indicates just how unavailable major works in economics were. The earliest translation of Adam Smith's \emph{Wealth of Nations} appeared no earlier than 1802; disparaged, the translation is now considered lost. P. A. Bibikov published the second translation in Russia in 1866. Although a copy would have theoretically been available for the earliest members of the Russian labor movements to read, there is no guarantee on the availability of Bibikov's translation. Even so, Smith's understanding of private central banking is as dissembling as it is advanced. It is hardly the case that the early Russian revolutionaries like Lenin or Trotsky might have picked up on the role of private central banking from Smith's metaphors prohibiting the suspension of commerce or industry from "the Daedalian wings of paper money" (Wealth of Nations II.ii.86) in the hands of private banks. A clue to the Bolshevik understanding of banking comes from the work great Russian revolutionaries like David Ryazanov completed as the head of the Marx and Engels Institute he founded shortly after the October revolution. During his time at the institute, Ryazanov produced one of the first Russian translation of David Ricardo's works: \textrussian{Рикардо Давид. Начала политической экономии и податного обложения. Перевод и вступительная статья Рязанов Д. Институт К. Маркса и Ф. Энгельса. Отпечатано в 1-й Образцовой типографии Гиза. Тираж 4000 экз. М.-Л. Государственное издательство. 1929г. 368 с.}. The translation, however, contains no reference to the famous analysis Ricardo produced in his work entitled, \emph{The High Price of Bullion: A Proof of the Depopulation of the Country} (1810). In the aforementioned work, Ricardo wrote: "The public, or the Government on behalf of the public, is indebted to the Bank in a sum of money larger than the whole amount of Bank notes in circulation; for the Government not only owes the Bank fifteen million, its original capital, which is lent at 3 per cent interest, but also many more millions which are advanced on Exchequer bills, on half-pay and pension annuities, and on other securities. It is evident, therefore, that if the Government itself were to be the sole issuer of paper money instead of borrowing it of the Bank, the only difference would be with respect to the interest: the Bank would no longer receive interest and the Government would no longer pay it; but all other classes in the community would be exactly in the same position in which they now stand." By the time Ryazanov published his translation of Ricardo's major contribution to political economy, Stalin's political genocide had already started, preventing Ryazanov, if not anyone else, from continuing to research the origins of economics. Marx himself did leave a clear explanation of the relation capital bore to the money supply, banking or the State. While Marx considers gold, or any other commodity backing, to be necessary no more than “in the imagination” (i.e., [Marx, K. (1970), \emph{A Contribution to the Critique of Political Economy}, Moscow: Progress. pg. 70]), the actions of the state (ibid., pg. 72) determine the  widespread acceptance of a given unit of account "purely [by] convention." Marx's point of view is thus congenial to Ricardo's about the "sole issuer of paper money" but only by implication. Although the Bolsheviks adopted the Czar's monetary policy, the literature on early Soviet monetary policy seemingly produces no example for its justification from Marx's works.}, Lenin's explination may be extended to the processes of concentration that shifted power away from America's industrialists to private central bankers in the immediate aftermath of America's rise to power after World War II when America's economy became the World Power. Writing just before the rise of Franklin Deleanor Roosevelt, Trotsky could have hardly been aware of the far-reaching consequences of America's much earlier decision to reject William Jennings Bryan for Woodrow Wilson's Secretary of the U.S. Navy for private central banking. \newline \indent A great admirer of Karl Lueger (1844 - 1910), the former mayor of Vienna, Austria, North modeled much of his concept of orchestration on Lueger's manipulation of social hatred. Much like tempering, orchestration seeks to exploit politically polarized issues with a carefully calibrated media spectacle or series of media spectacles so that the responses to these issues (i.e., like abortion or Israel) may be papered in such a way as to sway voters from one candidate to the other just before a major election. The deployment of Immigrations and Customs Enforcement to Minneapolis, Minnesota has provided, for instance, a series of media spectacles over the politically polarized issue of reasonable suspicion allow these issues to be papered in such a way as to sway voters before the November, 2026 mid-term elections; the Socialist Equality Party, for instance, utilizes a critique of an article in one of the major three corporate controlled newspapers to apply a psuedo-Marxist analysis in such a way that radical readers of the newspapers turn away from the corporate controlled media's critique to the SEP's critique, while less radical readers, who may or may not be familiar with the concept of "reasonable suspicion" channel opposition to the Republican party through the Democratic party. Opposition is thus cannelized into one or more direction; in terms of the SEP, the direction is to the State itself but through the police State bureaucracy's protocol against domestic extremists; in terms of the corporate controlled media, the direction is to the Republicans through the Democrats. In either case, opposition is cannelized into a direct under the control of the ruling elite in such a way that no opposition develops that is not under its control. The ultimate aim of orchestration is to guarantee authoritarianism, as Hannah Ardent described in her famous book on the subject. In her book, \emph{The Origins of Totalitarianism},\footnote{A counter argument to totalitarian authoritarianism in Hannah Ardent's book is the idea of "modern Constitutional authoritarianism" where the executor of a State such as a President merely tightens the controls on all aspects of the government's authority over the citizenry so discretely through a veneer of law that the citizenry cannot but stare at the State through a new glass wall. The problem with "modern Constitutional authoritarianism" is the same problem with Hannah Ardent's own definition of authoritarianism. Trotsky's critique of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics is just as relevant here for authoritarianism as for the inner party struggle the Bolsheviks led after the revolution. Trotsky's belief that a refusal to revert inner party control from bureaucratic to democratic socialism would necessarily cascade so that the party's collapse would cause the State's is as much a fiscal critique as it is a political analysis. The money required to maintain authoritarian forms of rule, is less relevant for regimes like the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics than the United States. The United States has exceeded the police State bureaucracy the U.S.S.R. set up with the KGB many times over. The U.S. has hundreds of agencies, tens of thousands of commissions, offices, departments, bureaus, or corporations but none have accomplished anything for the country, except drain the treasury. An NSA agent's salary, deployed to a target or not, is anywhere from 100,000 to 175,000. If a group is attached to a target, the operation on the target can range from anywhere to half a million to a million dollars, depending on the number of agents. Surveillance is thus extremely expensive. Neither Hannah Ardent nor others have really looked at the numbers on modern police State authoritarianism's requirements for surveillance. \emph{See} an article \emph{Foreign Policy} published on January 19th, 2026 under the title, "America’s Drift Toward Constitutional Authoritarianism," where the author completely omits any discussion of surveillance, the sine qua non of authoritarinism, or its expenditures (all of which are subject to public disclosure under Article 1, Section 9, Clause 7 of the U.S. Constitution). The idea of "modern Constitutional authoritarianism" is neither a species nor genera of the Ardent's, since the fulfill of her two elements soldifies the application of her definition. Whether the means of authoritarianism are legal (i.e., The Nuremberg Laws from 15 September 1935) or not is nothing more than a discussion of means. It is not a discussion of ends.} Ardent presented the definition of authoritarianism with two elements. These are as follows: "These forms of domination differ basically from other kinds of dictatorial, despotic or tyrannical rule; and even though they have developed, with a certain continuity, from party dictatorships, their essentially totalitarian features are new and cannot be derived from one-party systems. The goal of one-party systems is not only to seize the government administration but, by filling all offices with party members, to achieve a complete amalgamation of state and party, so that after the seizure of power the party becomes a kind of propaganda organization for the government. This system is "total" only in a negative sense, namely, in that the ruling party will tolerate no other parties, no opposition and no freedom of political opinion. Once a party dictatorship has come to power, it leaves the original power relationship between state and party intact; the government and the army exercise the same power as before, and the "revolution" consists only in the fact that all government positions are now occupied by party members. In all these cases the power of the party rests on a monopoly guaranteed by the state and the party no longer possesses its own power center." Orchestration\footnote{One of the tools in orchestration which the members of the Socialist Equality Party have adopted is Debord's so-called \emph{détournement}, "which involves using spectacular images and language to disrupt the flow of the spectacle." A most recent deployment of Debord's so-called \emph{détournement} is the SEP's decision to exploit the orchestrated, or, if he really did die, real death of Alex Pretti "to disrupt the flow of the spectacle" on ICE in Minneapolis, Minnesota, shifting the social outrage away from the overthrow of the American capitalist system to the abolition of ICE by means of a "general strike." The disruption to the flow of the ICE spectacle thus assumed the character of mass movements with mass movements staged throughout major cities over the course of a week with sophisticated social engineering tools on social media, politically debased psuedo-left parties like the Democratic Socialists of America, the Socialist Equality Party (where the elite orchestrators occupy highranking titled positions with publications under name or nom de plume), or Party for Socialism and Liberation, and Hollywood trained actors, grey ghost agent saboteurs, or aesthetically pleasing leaders like Abby Martin, who is married directly into the police State bureaucracy. Employed to create a documentary on the Pentagon, Martin frequently appears on the Central Intelligence Agency's latest news outlet, Breakthrough News. In terms of leadership for the masses, Abby Martin, for instance, looks really good so hearing her feels even better when she says: "I've never had more revolutionary optimism than I do right here [in Minneapolis]...Let's get ICE the f*ck out of our country!" It represents the so-called "aesthetic component of socialism" derived from one of the members of the Frankfurt school of post-Stalinist falsification. Alex Pretti's Debord's so-called \emph{détournement} thus transformed the content of the orchestration from random acts of reaction into a social movement under the Federal government's control or within the tentacles of the great octopus of Federated, centralized, technologically advanced agencies whose self-expressed aim is to suppress the Bill of Rights in their entirety. } is necessary to provide the illusion that the United States is not a one-party State but just as under Spinoza neither thought nor extension (AT VIIIA 30-31, CSM I 215) are two but one substance, the two dominant parties in the United States but modes of one Substance, differing primarily in the tactics they exploit to shift the working class in "perpetual movement" from one direction to another. The one-party of private central banking (which the SEP calls the party of big business) are both dedicated, for instance, to guarantee the continuation of Alexander Hamilton's corruption scheme to compel the Federal government to become indebted to private central bankers like Robert Morris through the sale U.S. Treasury Bonds whose interest the 16th Amendment extracts surplus value from workers to pay at a rate equivalent to more than 75 per cent per dollar.  The amalgamation of the party and the state is thus embodied in the commitment to Federal indebtedness. The toleration for no party other than the one party of private central banking is exemplified in the exclusion of third party candidates from U.S. elections, a process the Socialist Equality Party stages through its own participation. The realization of authoritarianism by orchestration or other means thus preserves the American ruling elite's continued rule over the United States. \newline \indent Orchestration, however, is not the only means of mass manipulation North developed. North developed the concept of Engel's cycle. In his reading of \emph{Dialectics of Nature}, which is the subject of a single entry, North emphasized how the crises of capitalism are no less terminable than the universe. North relied on Engel's preface. In his preface, Engel's describes how the destruction of the universe gives birth to the universe all over again in a perpetual cycle. Opposed to communism, North believes the crises of capitalism can be so manipulated as to preserve an aspect of the \emph{ancien regime} for the future regime from one collapse to the next through the imposition of an expanded Stalinist anti-Trotskyist police state bureaucracy beyond the KGB's wildest imagine (i.e., the modern American police State bureaucracy with the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the National Security Agency, the Central Intelligence Agency, the Department of Homeland Security, the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Agency, so on and so forth) so that the revolutionary party (the Socialist Equality Party), employed by one or more of these agencies, may stand in place of a genuine opposition during a revolution, foment revolution when revolution comes, or, if necessary, hold the \emph{ancien regime} over, unless or until a new, perhaps even more reactionary, regime takes over on the smoldering ashes of the \emph{ancien regime}, thereby exploiting the banner of the Fourth International for the construction of reactionary provisional governments, political bridges from one thoroughly destructive, reactionary, anti-Enlightenment regime to the next endlessly in an Engel's cycle. \footnote{The Sri Lanka revolution, where the North's SEP developed strong ties, is a perfect example of North's execution of an Engel's cycle on the Sri Lankan people. The Sri Lankan people, clueless about either the SEP or the incoming Sri Lankan regime, witnessed an Engel's cycle without a clue. It is profound achievement in politics. Not only did the Engel's cycle succeed but North's execution of the Engel's cycle, no doubt supported by the expanded Stalinist anti-Trotskyist police state bureaucracy, occured without a single line of conscious opposition. The Sri Lanka revolution is thus a model, a subject of study right now for all agents associated with David North's political device, for repetition in the United States, if not around the world.} \newline \indent David North's legacy is complex. His complexity exceeds the most complicated Marxists in the history of Marxism. Lenin, for instance, thoroughly discredited Parvus, for his corruption of Russian social democracy but unfairly without any redemption. In terms of Plekhanov, Lenin drew a line separating Plekhanov's periods of development. Lenin regarded Plekhanov to be a progressive contributor to the theoretical understanding of Marxism in the years preceding the split World War I caused at the last meeting of the Second International when Plekhanov voted in favor of Russian war credits, prompting Lenin to publish one of the pamphlets studied least of all within the circles of the Socialist Equality Party.\footnote{In a country whose more than two and half centuries is a history of war, the idea of social-chauvinism or social pacificism are hardly sufficient to gaslight the rampage, mayhem, or nihilism America's war machine has perpetuated (i.e., Afghanistan). The exclusion of Lenin's pamphlet, \emph{The imperialist war : the struggle against social-chauvinism and social-pacifism, 1914-1915}, is thus just as much a political decision as a part of the party's political decision making. An emphasis on programmatically invertable works such as the \emph{Results and Perspectives} (for \textfrench{coup d'états}) or \emph{Imperialism: The Highest Stage of Capitalism} (for capital, monopoly, or annexations) advances the party for gaslighting far more than a craft for the purity of a political commitment to Marxism during the death agony of capitalism.} Lenin, however, condemned the later Plekhanov for his decision to side with social-chauvinism for imperialist war. In terms of David North, the situation is far more complex than Parvus (whose influence ultimately led to Trotsky's theory of permanent revolution) or Plekhanov where the lines are hardly blurred. The damage North has accomplished with the decision to advance the Central Intelligence Agency's adoption of the Master of Deceit's predelicition for the exploitation of communism into an instrument for the State seals his fate forever. While North's contributions must be viewed only on an individual basis, North is nothing more than the most crowning achievement of the Frankfurt School of Marxism, the most professional, elite, accomplished Architect of American, if not Western Decline. His historical legacy will be regarded ultimately with negativity.
\newline \indent What about Who is David North? David North's earliest history may be traced to the 1970s. David North was born David Green. The son of a wealthy, successful, American businessman, North attended college at one of the unofficial group of small, academically competitive private liberal arts called the "Little Ivy." The "Little Ivy" was  Trinity College, a private liberal arts college in Hartford, Connecticut. Founded as Washington College in 1823, it is the second-oldest college in the state of Connecticut. Coeducational since 1969, the college has enrolled no more than 2,235 students a year. Offering 41 majors and 28 interdisciplinary minors, Trinity College is where David North first began to study history as a major. While studying history, North overthrew the editorial board of the college's newspaper, the Trinity Tripod. North became editor. Under his editorship, North is alleged to have acquired a reputation for "dishonesty and black of journalistic integrity," according to a document an agent of the police State bureaucracy leaked to the author.
\newline \indent A report from the Trinity Tripod dated October 31st, 1969 indicates that David Green, 71', advised by Dr. George Cooper, the head of the History Department, received a major breakthrough for his career in politics with Cooper's help. Cooper recommended Green work Senator Vance Hartke. Named, Rupert Vance Hartke (May 31, 1919 – July 27, 2003), Senator Vance Hartke, served as a Democratic United States Senator from Indiana for several sessions of Congress, spanning the period of the Vietnam war, from 1959 until 1977. Known as a hard-working, "liberal" Democrat with a strong relationship with Senate Majority Leader Lyndon B. Johnson, Hartke lobbied for programs such as Medicare and Medicaid, supporting the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Hartke wrote three books, \emph{Inside the New Frontier} (1962) \emph{The American Crisis in Vietnam} (1968), \emph{You and Your Senator} (1970), all of which are important for David's Green's intellectual development. Hartke agreed to Cooper's recommendation. North began serving in the office staff of Senator Vance Hartke. Described by a Dean Winslow as a "sort of internship," North's work "[involved] a study of Washington political structure and activity with an eye towards a career in politics." 
\newline \indent While not exactly an "internship," Hartke tapped North to head the launch of a major conspiracy against the First Amendment in American politics. While Hartke worked together with Johnson, Hartke's lesser known affiliations are with the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). Described as a "powerful force" and "giant" in Congress in the 1960s, Hartke's membership in the Senate Foreign Affairs Committee provided with access to advanced political conspiracies both the FBI and the Department of State began to plan in response to the rising tide of social unrest in the United States over the Vietnam war. While the exact name of the FBI's political conspiracy for David North's internship project is yet unknown, North believed the internship changed his life. 
\newline \indent According to North, by November 15th, 1969, "virtually nothing remained of my earlier hopes that the Democratic Party represented a progressive, let alone socialist, opposition to imperialism." That day he claims to have purchased a copy of Isaac Deutscher's first book in a three volume set dedicated to Leon Trotsky, "The Prophet Armed." Overnight, North supposedly transformed from a liberal to a follower of Leon Trotsky, except North's following of Leon Trotsky became an integral part of his service in the FBI and State Department. 
\newline \indent In January 1971, the Trinity Reporter said: "For example, senior David Green of Kew Gardens, N.Y. went to Washington D.C., where he interned in the office of Senator Vance Hartke of Indiana." The newspaper went on to describe the internship in the following way. "The result was that he fit in so well that six other senators wrote the college for student interns." It is unknown whether or not members of North's former alma matter became Northern followers. By no coincidence at all, David Green suddenly became David North, establishing himself as a leader in the Trotskyist movement. With the help of his friends in the Federal Bureau of Investigation, North ascended to the leadership of the Workers League. David's meteoric rise through the ranks of , first as Labor Editor of the Party's paper, \emph{The Bulletin}, then later, in 1976, the group's leader, could not have happened without willing hands from deep within the police State bureaucracy's vast, sprawling, ever widening network of agents. 
\newline \indent Corresponding with North's meteoric rise is the fact that Hartke developed plans with the FBI and the State Department whose exposition is revealed through a carefully crafted omission. In November 1971 when North began his internship with Hartke, the FBI refused to include the Worker's League alongside the Socialist Equality Party and Spartacist League in its Administrative Index, the so-called ADEX index of "threats to national security." When ADEX was started in 1971, it was made up of people who were formerly on the Security Index, Reserve Index, and Agitator Index (i.e., labor leaders). Maintained at two separate locations at the headquarters of the Masters of Deceit, the ADEX was discontinued in January 1978 for obvious violations of the First Amendment right to free speech.\footnote{A famous member of the ADEX, whose speeches are taught in elementary schools, whose likeness is minted onto American coins, or whose history of tenacity, grit or work earned a month in February dedicated to his heroism, is Martin Luther King Jr. The ADEX describes MLK Jr. as "[an] established civil rights leader [who] has acquired national and international status. Professes to adhere to philosophy of non-violence but past actions have provoked civil disobedience. On 8/14/1967 publicly committed SCLC to program of massive civil disobedience. Has publicly denounced U.S. participation in war with Vietnam." There can be no doubt that the under Hoover's conception of a "Master of Deceit" that the Federal Bureau of Investigation is one of the leading, if not the leading, cause of American's decline.} The Workers League's omission from the ADEX thus highlights the avanced plans Hartke, North, the FBI and the State Department implemented to sack the First Amendment from the people.

\entry{North-South Corridor} {} {} {During the Ukraine war, the International North-South Transport Corridor (INSTC), one of the railways at the heart of the the world's richest millionaires, centi-millionaires, or billionaires fighting to assert supremacy over the global supply chain of great trade routes, expanded rapidly throughout Eurasia, enumerating brand new statistics for installed rails, shipments or the types of shipments. While the ultimate aim of the North-South Corridor aims, like most of all the Eurasian trade-routes, to establish a land route from Russia through Eurasia to India, one of the largest global markets in the history of the 21st century, the North-South Corridor's significance for its expansion into Russia's immediate or proximate neighbors gained importance in the face of the U.S.-led NATO project overthrow Russia's European trade routes on the European continent\footnote{The Ukraine war accelerated European commerce on the continent. A 29 billion dollar megaproject to build the longest single rail tunnel in the world suddenly went underway, as the war roared on. The tunnel is designed to connect Lyon in France to Turin in Italy; the current route through the Alps is based on an 18th century design full of twists and turns; the tunnel is expected to optimize trade from truck to freight. Called the Mont Cenis Base Tunnel, it will exceed the Gotthard Base Tunnel in Switzerland by half a kilometer. Evidence that the Ukraine war is responsible for the project's acceleration is the document entitled, Commission Implementing Decision (EU) 2025/1715. Published on July 30th, 2025, the document required the "implementation of the Lyon-Turin cross-border project on the Mediterranean European Transport Corridor," mandating its completion.}, a process whose development follows closely the key milestones in Russia's full-scale invasion of the Ukraine.\footnote{In an exceptionally telling post on how the Ukraine war has resulted in a redrawn energy map on Sky News Arabic, a subtitle describes how "the first shot in the Ukraine war killed the energy map." (i.e., \textarabic{الرصاصة الأولى في حرب أوكرانيا قلبت خريطة الطاقة إلى الأبد.}) [SNABusiness: 1706965512322797576; September 27th, 2023] In this video, Sky News Arabic explains how the first bullet in the Ukraine war killed the pre-existing energy map in Europe, rerouting Russia's trade routes away from Europe to Eurasia. In turn, the U.S. routed its supply of energy to Europe. Algeria became a new supplier to Europe. ["Chevron Explores Algerian Gas Plans Amid Russian Sanctions," \emph{Wall Street Journal}. February 6th, 2023], ["The Unexpected New Winners in the Global Energy War," \emph{Wall Street Journal}. September 19th, 2023] In the initial aftermath of Russia's full-scale invasion, the West immediately imposed sanctions on the Russian imports for gas, coal, or oil, ending centuries of European reliance on cheap Russian energy. Slowly but surely the U.S. began to wean the countries less ideologically aligned to NATO off Russian energy. These are countries like Slovakia, Hungary, Romania, Bulgaria or Serbia. Later the U.S. successfully terminated Russian exports to Europe almost altogether, at least as far as the Ukraine as a transit hub is concerned. There can be no doubt that Russia's full-scale invasion served as an incredibly timely excuse to implement a plan, the likes of which Condalezza Rice espoused in an interview from 2014. In the interview, Rice the following: "Now we need to have tougher sanctions and I'm afraid at some point this is going to probably have to involve oil and gas. The Russian economy is vulnerable. 80 of Russian exports are an oil gas in minerals. People say well the Europeans will run out of energy. Well, the Russians will run out of cash before the Europeans run out of energy and I understand that it's uncomfortable to have an effect on business ties in this way but this is one of the few instruments that we have. Over the long run you simply want to change the structure of energy dependence; you want to depend more on the North American energy platform, the tremendous bounty of oil and gas that we're finding in North America; you want to have pipelines that don't go through Ukraine and Russia. For years we've tried to get the Europeans to be interested in different pipeline routes it's time to do that and so some of this is simply acting and acting as quickly as possible."} Russia initially expanded its railways to North Korea, a country whose shipments of war materiel have helped, some argue, an advantage in artillery over the Ukrainians. Russia continued, adding more countries. On September 12, 2023 Russia dispatched 36 wagons to Saudi Arabia through Iran's Icheh Borun border. \newline \indent Considered to be the result of a joint partnership for sending cargo contains via the INSTC from the Formacheva railway station via Akyayla (Turkmenistan) to Incheh Borun, the route facilitates the path container trains take from the southern Ural railway stations to the port city of Bandar Abbas via Sarakhs or Incheh Borun. On October 2nd, 2023, a Russian train containing 31 wagons had traveled 1, 610 kilometers on Iran's railway in three and a half days to arrive at the Iranian port city, Bandar Abbas Central District of Bandar Abbas County, Hormozgan province, Iran for shipment from there to Saudi Arabia by sea.Russia's chosen route reduced customs tariffs to almost half the normal price, breathing new life into the Iranian rail transport industry through an increase in the share of transit goods the Islamic Republic of Iran's railways enjoys. The train travelled through both Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan before reaching Iran. It bypassed the alternative maritime route through the troubled Suez Canal that the dwindling naval power of the United States could no longer guarantee in the face of the Houthi's unrelenting attacks on container ships. On November 5th, 2025, Russia exported refined oil in the form of different types of fuels such as gasoline and diesel to Afghanistan via Iran. Russia's diesel fuel shipped from Russia to the Iranian Caspian seaport of Amirabad; from Amirabad to Mashhad; from Mashhad to Afghanistan on the semi-finished Khaf-Herat railway.\footnote{The Khaf-Herat railroad is a 225 km standard-gauge (1, 435mm), non-electric rail line linking north-eastern Iran to western Afghanistan. Proposed in 1975 to transport iron ore from nearby mines in Afghanistan to Iran, the railway is one of the many projects the Taliban government revived after an ugly American withdrawal on August 30, 2021 during Biden's war administration.}  \newline \indent The INTSC connects the major economies on the Eurasia to Russia. Articulated in Russia's strategy for the country's fundamental supply chain,\footnote{["\textrussian{Новак: транспортный коридор "Север - Юг" станет основой для цепи поставок в России," \emph{ТАСС}, 21 апреля, 2022 года}.]} the INTSC represents a major shift in the history of global trade in Eurasia.\footnote{Alongside the INSTC, which is a primarily Russian dominated trade, are the trade-routes on Eurasian railways leading to China. On May 25th, 2025, the first freight train from Xi'an, China, arrived at the Iranian port city, Aprin, a historic milestone for the development of Sino-Iranian relations. The historic land route reduces the time by sea from 30 to 40 days to 15 days by rail. The reduction of the journey by 15 to 25 days represents the immensely powerful transformation domination of a land route in Eurasia imparts to its ruling power. These statistics indicate that China theoretically doubled the amount of its transit goods. Alongside China, Saudi Arabia, one of the many centers of power in Eurasia, announced the issue of tenders for a 1,000-mile railway between the Red Sea and the Persian Gulf for linking Saudi Arabia's oil giant, Aramco, from Jeddah on the Red Sea through Riyadh to the country's east coast ports in a move designed to bypass the Suez Canal altogether. Shortly before the fourth anniversary of the Ukraine war, Riyadh began to construct its land-bridge, signifying how by coincidence or causality the Ukraine war became witness to changes in Eurasia's trade routes that are expected to influence mankind for centuries.["Saudi Arabia to Seek Bidders for 1,000-Mile Red Sea-Gulf Railway," \emph{Bloomberg}, September 18th, 2017] It is hard to imagine how quickly history began to move in the face of the Ukraine war but even countries with a much lower profile than Saudi Arabia such as the United Arab Emirates, whose significance is addressed in a separate entry, traversed a new land route for its trade. [Red Sea Attacks Force Firms to Test New Land Routes via UAE, Saudi, \emph{Bloomberg},February 2nd, 2024] } A salient feature of previously oceanic routes becoming territorial is a Suez Canal\footnote{The Suez Canal underwent a fundamental transformation during the Ukraine war. Prior to the Ukraine war, the Suez Canal dominated shipping lanes for Eurasian countries transporting goods to or from the Mediterranean to the Persian Gulf. During the Ukraine war, major shipping companies such as Hapag-Lloyd began to call for the utilization of territorial routes such as Saudi Arabia's land-bridge, as many major German newspapers, newsreels, or broadcasters announced. ["Hapag-Lloyd bietet durch Saudi-Arabien an," \emph{Der Spiegel}, January 22nd, 2024]} reduced in significance.

The first \emph{Nova} documentary broadcast less than ten years after the last episode in a series called \emph{The Bell System Science Series}. \newline \indent A predecessors to \emph{Nova} such as \emph{The Bell System Science Series} accomplished much to lay the groundwork for scientific exegesis. The Bell System Science Series consisted of nine television episodes lasting less than 30 minutes apiece made for the AT\&T Corporation\footnote{In the 20th century, companies like AT\&T, which were akin then to that of the Magnificent Seven now, funded major projects for America's cultural, scientific, intellectual development.

The vast majority of the activities of the Magnificent Seven have contributed nothing but to the expansion of America's police state bureaucracy with the creation of backdoors for America's police state agencies, departments, commission, offices, bureaus, or departments to utilize without a warrant in a massive expansion of the Federal government's ability to eavesdrop on their everyday activities like bathroom breaks or purchasing tampons.

The episodes read more like Socratic dialogues with the characters asking each other questions than a storyline with characters who undergo changes in the face of an adventure. \newline \indent The first four are called Capra films after their producer, Frank Capra.\footnote{Prior to his production of \emph{The Bell System Science Series}, Capra produced seven episodes in a series on World War II under the eye of the War Department. These are Prelude to War (1942), The Nazis Strike (1943), Divide and Conquer (1943), The Battle of Britain (1943), The Battle of Russia (1943), The Battle of China (1944), War Comes to America (1945). Produced alongside the war, these films represented a considerable achievement in the visual arts. The 20th century is full of wars but few have ever received as much coverage as Capra's series.} Capra released \emph{Our Mr. Sun} in (1956), \emph{Hemo the Magnificient} in (1957), \emph{The Strange Case of the Cosmic Rays} in (1957),\footnote{One of the most curious aspects of the Capra films is the roundtable of puppets representing Fyodor Dostoevsky, Edgar Allen Poe and Charles Dickens, who apparently hosted a contest about the great mystery of matter and the universe. It is unclear why Capra selected these authors over all others, as few, if any, books they wrote ever deal directly with the question of matter or the universe.} and \emph{The Unchained Goddess} in (1958). Capra later described the films: "Those four films about science, hand woven with bits of celluloid, were sprightly patterns of poesy and fact; fresh ideas were their main charm, a rather elegant charm, we thought, much like the light-hearted but disciplined charm of a Mozart composition.\footnote{Capra, Frank (1997). \emph{The name above the title: an autobiography.} DaCapo Press. p. 443.} \newline \indent Warner Brothers took over production of the next four after firing Capra for his emphasis on a pedantic agenda designed to portray science as the "Holy Spirit."\footnote{The "Holy Spirit" is so elusive that Muslims claim Jesus prophesied Mohammed's coming in John 16:7-14 where the word interpreted to "Holy Spirit" is semantically unjustifiable within the context of the Ancient Greek koine. In Surah As-Saf Ayat 6 in the Holy Quran, the passage discusses the one from John.} Warner Brothers produced the next four in the series. These are \emph{Gateways to the Mind} in (1958), \emph{The Alphabet Conspiracy}, in (1959), \emph{Thread of Life} in (1960), \emph{About Time} in (1962), the last of which is undeniably a classic of unparalleled quality. There is perhaps no competing work capable of the depth of explanation the film achieves. Disney produced the last video, The Restless Sea, in (1964). These experiments, whose producers, screenwriters, or production changed almost per episode, laid the groundwork for future educational documentaries in the sciences in America.

Sanctions have nothing to do with Russia's economy. They have been focused primarily on securing the transformation of Europe’s trade routes away from Russia to the U.S. Secondarily, sanctions ranked the geopolitical order for China, India, Russia and U.S. The application of sanctions occurred in a step-wise fashion. At first the U.S. secured “strategic input substitution” on Turkey’s crude with Brazil; the second step-wise application is to secure Venezuela’s crude for SIS in India. Kolbeissi, for instance, claim this is the next step. This makes Russia sequentially less powerful than China or India, subordinating Russia’s great power to the former. The U.S. imposed sanctions based on a calculated risk. While sanctions would certainly hasten the speed with which BRICS countries abandoned the dollar for a BRICS currency, the U.S. gambled that the transformation would succeed ahead of or in spite of the abandonment. The gambled paid off. While sanctions have accomplished the transformation, the transformation, however, has not produced results for the U.S. It has not, for instance, solved any of the problems related to the trade deficit, the Federal debt or the dollar. The startling revelation that the revenues from oil have not had an impact on any aspect of the U.S. 
economy is clear from the data on the subject. China’s capacity for oil refinement exceeds the U.S.’s. The price of oil is slipping to new lows.  Whether or not sanctions continue to secure the rank in the geopolitical order for the U.S. is dependent upon the death of the collapsed dollar; the collapsed dollar, which no longer enjoys the Petrodollar, lacks the legitimacy it once enjoyed. While major commodities contracts have continued to utilize the currency, the rise in competiting currencies 
has displaced the dollar significantly. The ability to leverage sanctions through the SWIFT system will die with the death of the collapsed dollar. It is unlikely that the sanctions on
Russia will secure the ranking, let alone the transformed European trade routes for the simple reason that the death of the collapsed dollar has already entered an extremely advanced
state.

\entry{Optimus} {} {} {Elon Musk's proposal for prisoners to be released in exchange for these prisoners to be subject to the surveillance of a robot called "Optimus" is a radical departure from the various means of punishment contemporary America's system of 'justice' has yet to embrace. The problem with Musk's proposal is what is wrong with contemporary America's own system of 'justice' now. America's system of 'justice' suffers from two problems; the system does not concentrate on an elimination of the root cause of crime but on its effects; the second is that the system is so corrupted that to speak of it as a system of 'justice' is as flawed as trying to speak of justice itself in the United States. \newline \indent An "Optimus" would be less humane, since the aim of justice is to eliminate crime. If "Optimus" cannot but correct the predictable behavior of an individual person, who is already 'convicted' of a crime, "Optimus" is more of a prophylactic than a cure.\footnote{["Elon Musk Says Tesla Robots Can Prevent Future Crime," \emph{Newsweek}. November 11th, 2025]} \newline \indent Musk makes the claim that Optimus' brain is a real human brain. It is hard to believe this statement. A human brain is formed through the process of live conception from insemination to death. Unless Musk has a way to form an Optimus' brain through live conception from insemination to death, then Optimus' brain most certainly will not be a real human brain. It is important to emphasize just far removed from experience Artificial Intelligence truly is. The difference is even stronger in terms of time. A key feature of the real human brain is the ability to follow points in a conversation over time. AI, for instance, cannot track a conversation over time in the same way that a human being can track a conversation; AI, in fact, does not track a conversation over time at all; AI has absolutely no sense of time whatsoever. An AI agent, be it any of the major products deployed on the Internet right, cannot relate a point from an earlier period of time in a conversation to a later one, reason about the difference of those two points, or produce a synchronous response to those two points at a third point in time. The idea of a synchronous conversation where a later point evolves from earlier or an earlier point at a third time is not a function that AI has. Without the synchronicity of conversation, AI agents thus lack a key feature of the real human brain. These disparities make the idea of a real human brain for Optimus hard to understand.}

\entry{Oppenheimer} {} {} {One of the worst film productions in the history of Hollywood, if not film altogether, \emph{Oppenheimer} (2023) attempts to portray the construction of the atom bomb with felicity. While the film itself is so insignificant as to be completely forgetable, an important scene portrays Kurt Gödel\footnote{ David Malone is incorrect to claim, as he does in his 2008 BBC documentary called \emph{Dangerous Knowledge} that Kurt Gödel's decision to pursue mathematics led inevitably to his madness or ultimate suicide, since Gödel developed his incompleteness theory well before his 30s.} at Princeton walking with Einstein in the gardens. The scene is important for humanity. Gödel became the greatest logician in the history of mankwind with the publication of incompleteness theorem. Gödel's work became significant during the third anniversary of the Ukraine war shortly after Elon Musk's ChatGPT erupted in a revolution for technology. In the latter half of the year, many experts began to espouse views related to complete systems. In many of the analogies these experts have invoked, most claim mathematics is to AI. In one analogy, for instance, Hinton compared mathematics to chess. Since computers play chess well, he reasoned that AI could play mathematics well, as though mathematics is a complete system like the game of chess.\footnote{To make matters worse for Hinton, Hofstadter (1979) in \emph{Gödel, Escher, Bach: an Eternal Golden Braid} extends Gödel's incompleteness theorem to any Turing-complete computational system, obliterating Hinton's hypothesis as dead on arrival.} Gödel's incompleteness theorem\footnote{Aristotle never had a problem with unprovable first principles in geometry, logic, or elsewhere. In his \emph{Prior Analytics}, Aristotle treats the principle of non-contradiction as a source of apodeitic knowledge. The principle of non-contradiction requires no feature to be both true and untrue in the same way at the same time. It is self-evident. If it were not self-evident, then any opposition must fall silent, for the act of negation requires the opponent to assume the truthfulness of the principle. Hence there is no way to accept the principle except apodeitically. Apodeitic knowledge, however, is anathema to the AI pronponents of a world designed to function according to the defunct Mathematica Principia.} thus became relevant for easily dispelling myths about AI like Hinton's.

\entry{Orchestration} {} {} {Orchestration is an American technique of propaganda for the subversion of struggles into dramas whose political polarization is desnigend to sway American public opinion in a specific direction. While, on the one hand, the events orchestration coordinates to happen are really happening, the fact that they happen or are happening, on the other hand, excuses none of the coordination responsible for this or that happenstance. The outcome is usually the only way to tell whether an event is the result of orchestration or the result of individual actors actually involved in a controversy whose outcome is not orchestrated by coordination. \newline \indent There are numerous categories of orchestration now, as the practice of orchestration has expanded immensely since the collapse of the Union of Soviet Socialists Republics on December 26th, 1991.\footnote{The fall of the U.S.S.R. represented the fall of the object of external opposition. Infiltrated by the massively ever widened police State bureaucracy in America, political parties in the U.S. could no longer pose a threat to the existing political order for lack of external opposition. The reason for which the massively ever widened police State bureaucracy justified infiltration consequently evaporated. If the object of infiltration was to prevent the object of external opposition from exerting control, influencing or playing a role in America's own internal politics, the fall of the U.S.S.R., ipso facto, eliminated that justification, eliminating the primary motivation of the massively ever widened police State bureaucracy's infiltration. The response became a shift from external opposition to any or all internal opposition to the ruling elite's decision making for society. Whereas American communists were the perceived threat in the face of the U.S.S.R., any or all dissenting Americans suddenly became the new threat for which agents of the unjustified police State bureaucracy grasped to justify the gravy train.} In terms of Article III, the part of the U.S. Constitution responsible for the establishment of Courts, the practice has only recently resulted in the proliferation of an overwhelming number of Court cases, the vast majority of which amount to nothing more than a singularly prodigal waste of America's money, since the outcome is usually designed to appear as impasse but can terminate in a final determination on the merits. \newline \indent The most recent case of orchestration is one of the most obvious for anyone familiar with the Department of Justice in the United States of America. On or before August 10th, 2025, one or more members of the Department of Justice instructed Sean Charles Dunn, a fellow employee at the DoJ, to purchase a sandwich at Subway\footnote{It is characteristic of America's ruling elite that the orchestration involved a sandwich from Subway. It is probably to exploit the case for marketing. Subway is an underperforming asset for American food.} for a media spectacle. Dunn approached U.S. Customs and Border Protection agents gathered at a spot about which one or more of the members of the DoJ told Dunn they would be, waiting for him. These members of the DoJ informed the U.S. Customs and Border Protection agents that a member of the DoJ named Dunn would be approaching them with a sandwich. Dunn issued a few remarks before suddenly throwing the sandwich at the U.S. Customs and Border Protection agents. Pam Bondi, the Attorney General, filed false charges to a Grand Jury or pre-selected members of the public with specific instructions for these members to deny the impending charges. Bondi claimed on social media: "If you touch any law enforcement officer, we will come after you,"\footnote{Bondi's remarks regarding law enforcement are instructive. Bondi's statement indicates that the Department of Justice has no problem orchestrating Court cases for the sake of dispatching messages in a vile repudiation of Article III, defiling the U.S. Constitution, the instrument for which Bondi has been charged with implementing for executing Thomas Jefferson's injunction against the English crown from July 4th, 1776. No citizen should ever tolerate the defilement of the Department of Justice for orchestration under any circumstance, for the U.S. is nothing but the executor of the Declaration of Independence. Should the members of the Federal government choose to be instruments of private central bankers, they invoke Jefferson's recommendation automatically. Jefferson says, "That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it." Under the doctrine of popular sovereignty, where the Courts are complicit in orchestration, the idea that nothing more than proposing a bill to members of the House of Representatives or the Senate for an Amendment to the U.S. Constitution to prohibit orchestration is as futile as the history of acceptance for the 16th Amendment, if not the history of ratification for the 28th Amendment.} Bondi posted online Thursday. "Not only is he FIRED, he has been charged with a felony." In the sequentially staged aspects of Dunn's case, the pre-selected members of the grand jury returned a rejection for Bondi's first request for a felony. Later they returned a rejection for a misdemeanor. The newspapers, the majority of which no longer register validity, legitimacy, or veracity for the few members of the reading public still subscribed, published article after article, detailing Dunn's case; designed to appeal to the citizens who have identified Trump's deployment of U.S. Custom and Border Protection's behavior as unacceptable, Dunn's role in the orchestration provides false hope of successful resistance. The message is that citizens can resist. They are more than welcome to throw Subway sandwiches at members of U.S. Customs and Border Protection agents. A grand jury will return a rejection for a felony. It serves as a sense of relief when these citizens unconsciously read how Dunn managed to escape the charges. Little do the citizens know that both the felony as well as the misdemeanor charges were deliberately staged acts of malicious prosecution Dunn knew he would escape when he first spoke to his coworkers to orchestrate the media spectacle. It is mark of arrogance and irony that Bondi describes the incident as "an example of the Deep State we have been up against for seven months."\footnote{The Deep State is the Federal government. The fact that Dunn was a DoJ agent is a dead giveaway. No one believes the Federal government anymore. It has long since exhausted the law of diminishing returns with its exploitation of suspended disbelief.}

\entry{Palantir} {} {} {A centralized intelligence agency deployed to the Ukraine war, Palantir has exploited the Ukraine for experiments with Artificial Intelligence since the beginning of the war, if not earlier. In an article published by \emph{Time} magazine shortly after the fall of Avdiivka on January 17th, 2024 under the title, "How Tech Giants Turned Ukraine Into an AI War Lab," Mykhailo Fedorov, Ukraine’s Minister of Digital Transformation, claims his “big mission is to make Ukraine the world’s tech R\&D lab.” In the article, Jacob Helberg, a national-security expert who serves as an outside-policy adviser to Palantir's CEO, Alex Karp, calls Palantir "the AI arms dealer of the 21st century.” (February 4th, 2024) \newline \indent In an interview with Tom Mackenzie on November 14th, 2025, Palantir's UK head, Louis Mosley, described how the Ukraine is a "research and development lab for AI" in the battlefield. Palantir cites "extraordinary acceleration" in military technology. Mosley likened the speed with which Ukraine is required to reach the bleeding edge of technology for military innovation to that of the Allies during World War II when Germany's strategic bombing on the United Kingdom brought about some fundamental discovery in radar.\footnote{Although it is unclear what is meant exactly by raids across the English Channel, an educated guess may be the Nazis' \emph{Vergeltungswaffen}. In \emph{Weapons of Weapons of Mass Destruction} Robert Hutchinson details how the Allies utilized SCR-548 "gun laying radar to automatically track and predict the V-1 flight paths." (2003; pg. 44) It is unclear what advances the Allies made or at what speed these advances were made. In World War II the major innovations in radar with the SCR-548 proceeded primarily from Allied 'strategic bombing.' An air enthusiast, for instance, claims General Quesada developed the SCR 584 radar system. Beneath a picture of Adolf Hitler behind Stuka dive bombers, the cover of \emph{Airpower} from Winter 1989, he writes: “In contrast, General Quesada innovated. He used the microwave early warning (MEW) radar and the SCR-584 anti-aircraft radar in several new and unplanned ways, building an entire command and control network centered around this new technology. He put radio intercept operations (Y-Service) with MEW and radio controllers to help win the air battle. To assist ground-attack missions, MEW operators coordinated with SCR-584 operators to provide navigation and precise control to fighter bombers. The wide-band MEW was used for long-range and area control, while the SCR-584, with its narrow beam, was used for close-range, precision work.” (Carter, 1989; pg. 26) During which of the Nazis' 'strategic bombing' did the English develop the SCR-584 radar system? Or did General Quesada develop the system for the Allies' own 'strategic bombing'?} \newline \indent Digital Transformation is a term developed before OpenAI's first release of ChatGPT. OpenAI's first release of ChatGPT transformed the algorithmic revolution\footnote{Ram Charan's \emph{Attacker's Advantage}, written before the OpenAI's first release of ChatGPT, details the algorithmic revolution. The attacker's advantage refers to the fact that an entity (like a business or individual) who is the first to act gains a strategic advantage over competitors. The ability to identify and exploit opportunities before others do, particularly in a rapidly changing environment, distinguishes an attacker from the attacked. (February 24, 2015)} into the AI revolution. Designed primarily for sales at technology companies, the term is a pitch for likening the failure to embrace the algorithmic revolution to Kodiak's refusal to digitize for photos. Kodiak's refusal to digitize its photos ultimately led to its extermination. It is term deeply involved in the theory of social Darwinism where the strongest companies adopt the latest, greatest, strongest differentiation for thriving against competitors.\footnote{The theory of social Darwinism for the Ukraine, however, is slippery slop. The Ukraine specially inferior to Russia in several important respects. Is that the right ethical or moral framework for understanding Ukraine's struggle against Russia or Russia's against Ukraine? The above mentioned article from \emph{Time} magazine, on the contrary, likens Ukraine's situation not to the evolution of species but the battle David fought against Goliath in the Old Testament. Which ethical or moral framework best describes Ukraine's or Russia's situation? Does the matter relate not to Darwin nor David but an altogether different struggle? Isn't David's pebble a much better analogy for a discussion about weapons? It is an example of a technologically advanced weapon for defeating a much larger, more powerful, more advanced enemy.} \newline \indent The rise of Karp is a response to the aftermath Edward Snowden's decision to leak to the American and internal press evidence of the Federal government's conspiracy to deprive citizens of the right to be free from unwarranted searches and seizures under the Fourth Amendment. In contrast to technology leaders like Tom Siebel, whose book on digital transformation dedicates no more than a few paragraphs to social darwinism with the remainder laser focused on the technology of his product at C3.ai, Karp's book is a politically motivated invocation for the Silicon Valley, the 8th Wonder of the World, to shift away from innovation for improving the state of the art in technology, the individual or society at large, to the promotion of a type of nationalism commensurate with the aims of imperialism. Karp's book, \emph{The Technological Republic}, advocates for technology companies to focus on solving problems related to the struggle of a nation-state to assert dominance on the global scene. \newline \indent Karp's book is based largely on an analogy. It compares the existing situation in the United States to that shortly before WWII, advocating for a resumption of the war years under Roosevelt. The problem with Karp's analogy is that the United States has underwent tremendous change. The ratio of debt to GDP during WWII for America's war machine during WWII represented a percentage far more manageable than the current. The current ratio of debt to GDP is 125 percent. During the WWII years the ratio was  Whereas in the period before WWII, the Federal debt represented no more than a fraction of GDP year over year, the Federal debt consistently exceeds GDP now.\footnote{The attempt to revive 'the Arsenal of Democracy,' whose rise alone during the Ukraine war consumes innumerable reams of paper, recently became the subject of a new book published by the Center for Strategic and International Studies. In his book, \emph{The American Edge}, Seth Jones argues for a resumption of the 'Arsenal of Democracy' in America. He bases his call for America's transformation on the same analogy as Karp's: American's 'Arsenal of Democracy' from the administration under Franklin Delano Roosevelt.} The technology before WWII is unlike technology now. AI, whose scope extends past digitization, algorithms, or automation, is a type of technology like no previous technology in the history of mankind. In contrast with previous types of technology (i.e., digitization, algorithms, or automation), AI is \emph{almost} sui-generis.\emph{The attempt to compare AI to consciousness is one of the most flawed analogies in the history of philosophy, since AI has absolutely nothing comparable to what might be called experience for human beings, the unity of cognition from birth to death in the form of memories. AI, for instance, is not borne; it does not die. It has no unity of experience.} It has the ability to create parts of itself on its own. No such technology existed during the war years. The fourth problem with Karp's analogy is quality of life. The idea that America's economy made Americans better off than before the war years is false. Higgs\footnote{[Higgs, R (1992), “Wartime prosperity? A reassessment of the US economy in the 1940s”, Journal of Economic History 52: 41–60.], [Higgs, R (1999), “From central planning to market, the American transition, 1945–1947”, Journal of Economic History 59: 600–23.], [Higgs, R (2006), Depression, war, and Cold War: Studies in political economy, New York: Oxford University Press.]} provides ample evidence that they were not. Most Americans, who labored during WWII, experienced what might better be called a sacrifice. Normal consumption dropped. Americans worked longer and harder. A significant number of Americans gave up life and limb to join the French and British fight Germany, Italy and Japan for parts of their defeated empires to be incorporated into America's. A fifth argument is that the establishment of the 'Arsenal of Democracy' is rooted in a legitimate concern over the implications Adolf Hitler's Nazi party had for the Enlightenment; since there is no comparable leader, party or regime, the modern call for an 'Arsenal of Democracy' lacks the political justification its past enjoyed.  Karp's analogy for a 'technological Republic' is a ploy to convince young Americans to shift away from self-improvement, societal good or technological advancement towards the pursuit of American nationalism, the aims of imperialism, or the establishment of the United States of America as the leading, undisputed, global superpower. \newline \indent Karp is one of the least convincing of all the founders installed in America's technology companies. He is really bizarre. His arguments are more a "pauper's brew of eclecticism" than the reflection of an intellectual dedicated to groundbreaking research. You do not hear major figures like Bezos, Gates, or Musk making stupid comments about national security. It is unclear why America’s bourgeoisie has so much faith in Karp to keep appearances.  Karp's argument about American police state surveillance, for instance, being superior to a state of inferiority with relation to China in terms of the global race for AI is a really more of a reflection of his exceptional ignorance of technology than national security.\footnote{["Palantir CEO Says a Surveillance State Is Preferable to China Winning the AI Race," \emph{Gizmodo}, November 7th, 2025]} In the history of technology, there is no precedent for the idea of a perpetually guarded invention. The atom bomb, for instance, is a perfect example here. In no less than four years after the United States dropped an atom bomb on Japan did the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics manage to build its own.\footnote{Hutchinson details how the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics managed to build its own atomic bomb in his book, \emph{Weapons of Mass Destruction}).} It cannot be that Karp actually believes achieving a four year advantage (give or take) is a sufficient basis to justify the Federal government imposing a systematic deprivation of the Fourth Amendment right to be free from unwarranted searches or seizures on the entirety of the United States, especially for Palantir. Palantir is nothing compared to the Bill of Rights. Had there never been a Bill of Rights in the first place, no tech company could have ever enjoyed the freedom Palantir has. Palantir's (theoretical, hypothetical, or conjectural) attainment of a four year advantage in the race for AI is not calculated to benefit American citizens but Palantir. Neither Karp nor Palantir have ever articulated how the attainment of an advantage in the race for AI over China may benefit Americans. The relative benefit a four year advantage in the race for AI (whose value cannot be assessed but to be below that of the power a nuclear bomb provides a state) relates least of all to a prospective justification for an acceptable relinquishment of a right in the Bill of Rights. No citizen believes the value to exceed that of his or her right to , life, liberty or the pursuit of happiness or to be free (from unwarranted searches or seizures). \newline \indent Karp's argument thus attempts to persuade Americans by way of fear that the concomitant loss of a right from the Bill of Rights is far safer than the ensuing lack of security China's attainment of an advantage in the race for AI might pose. His argument, however, is not only a work of poor intellectual craftsmanship but easily one of the least enthymematic of the scaremongering so commonly expressed in the mouths of post-9/11 American politicians. The mantra so frequently evoked in the endless stream of now unbelievably mistrusted American mainstream news on post-9/11 American politicians is to trade freedom for safety. Educated in the words of Thomas Jefferson, no American would ever trade his or her freedom for safety. America's decision to sacrifice safety for freedom in the American Revolution is epitomized in Thomas Jefferson's Declaration of Independence. Karp's argument is really about selling safety for lively profit from freedom's death. It is an anti-American subversion of one of America's founding principles. \newline \indent One of the other claims Karp raises is that an America's power relative to competitors determines the scope, number, or exercisability of an American's rights. He says, "You will have far fewer rights if America is not in the lead."\footnote{"U.S. must "absorb a lot of risk" in AI race, says Palantir's Karp," \emph{Axios}. November, 25th, 2025.} Karp's claim is hard to understand. Does Karp mean to suggest that Article III courts are less willing to provide American's their rights through judicial activism when the United States operates on the global scene without the dominant, leading, world historical decision making capacity a superpower enjoys? Is it so when the U.S. becomes only a competiting great power? Does Karp mean to suggest that as America's power relative to its ability to wield the bleeding edge on the technology of AI weakens so do an American's rights; if so, how? How is it that a change in America's power relates to that of an American's rights? Where does the ratio come from? On what is the ratio or proportion based? Does Karp mean that the Legislature rather than Article III courts will pass legislation reducing an American's rights, if and only if, the United States fails to assert power commensurate with what is needed to guarantee that removed right? How is it that Karp can claim that an American's rights depends upon America's power relative to competitors? How does that ratio or proportion work in a constitutional Republic like the United States of America? Is it possible to reduce Karp's ambiguous claim to a smokescreen? Is it Karp's intention to scaremonger Americans into the belief that access to, enjoyment of, or control over rights depends upon how often, how many, or to what extent he or she is ready to sacrifice a right for the United States to gain an advantage in AI and, if an American is able to secure access to, enjoyment of, or control over rights only when he or she sacrifices a right, which right is unknown, how is it that by sacrificing what is to be gained, an American's relations to his or her rights is thereby improved. Isn't that \emph{ex hypothesi}? How can an American's relation to his or her rights be improved by their sacrifice. Is that sacrifice limited, unlimited, temporary, permanent, complete, incomplete, total, or partial? It seems that analysis of Karp's claims leads inevitably to ambiguity, lack of clarity or obscurity. It is not that Karp is speaking about "Ukraine, ICE, Israel and generally telling the truth." It is that Karp's statements are incapable of being understood in any real sense of the word definition,\footnote{In his famous essay under the title, "An Essay Concerning Human Understanding," John Locke, one of the primary pillars upon which modern society builds the structure of an Enlightened society, says there are many types of words whose meaning does not meet the criteria by which a term \emph{defiendum} corresponds to a \emph{defiens}. Hume writes: "Languages are not always so made, according tot he Rules of Logick, that every term can have its signification exactly and clearly expressed by two terms." (III. iv. 7). Some words cannot be defined by other, "[for] if the Terms of one Definition, were still to be defined by another,  Where at last should we stop?" (III. iv. 5). Karp's claim, however, is not one of these indefinable types, since many different definable types are already so enunciated. The problem is that his claim is ambiguous beyond terminology.} claim, proposition, or inference.

\entry{Perelman, Grigori Yakovlevich} {} {} {Grigori Yakovlevich Perelman, a Russian Jew, is the greatest geometer of the 21st century. Born in the formerly besieged city of Leningrad, Perelman solved the soul conjecture in 1995, for which both Princeton and Stanford offered him positions but he rejected all of these universities for a position at the St. Petersburg Department of Steklov Mathematical Institute of the Russian Academy of Sciences, returning to his homeland. He worked there from 1995 to 2006. During that time, Perelman solved \textfrench{Poincaré} conjecture. Rather than waste his time on waiting for one of the journals mathematicians in academia must submit their work for enumerating lists of publications (that tenure committees utilize to decide tenure), Perelman resolved on an entirely different path. Perelman bypassed all of these journals, publishing his own work by himself on the popular website \emph{arXiv}. Perelman's decision was the first in many steps designed to demonstrate to his colleagues how the true pursuit of mathematics proceeds. Even though Perelman did not publish his findings in a major journal, Perelman's discovery of a solution for \textfrench{Poincaré}'s conjecture, nonetheless, earned him a place in the history of the greatest mathematicians in the history of the world. \newline \indent Since \textfrench{Poincaré}'s conjecture had been a famous open problem in mathematics for the past century, the International Mathematical Union decided to award Perelman a Fields Medal for his solution. On December 22nd, 2006, the scientific journal, \emph{Science}, recognized in Perelman's proof the solution to  \textfrench{Poincaré}'s conjecture as the scientific "Breakthrough of the Year," a first in the area of mathematics. Perelman, however, responded to the IMU with the following: "I'm not interested in money or fame; I don't want to be on display like an animal in a zoo." Perelman thereby rejected the Fields Medal. \newline \indent In his decision to reject the Fields Medal together with its prize of a billion pennies, Perelman performed an unparalleled service for all of humanity not just at that time, now, but for the future, for he made the IMU feel like what it is. One of academia's many zoos. \newline \indent In particular, academia is one of the institutions the ruling elite around the world weaponize to oppress the freedom of thought at all points throughout all aspects of human curiosity. Just like the great mathematician, Alexander Grothendieck, before him, Perelman rejected the institutions 21 century set up to identify, influence or control mathematicians. Grothendieck, who burned hundreds of papers he had written in his rejection of 20th century institutions, abandoned academia in its entirety to become a shepherd with a flock of sheep in the French countryside. Like Grothendieck, Perelman quit academia to live with his mother in an apartment in his hometown. \newline \indent It is clear from the behavior of these mathematicians, both of whom contributed immensely to the progress of human thought in different areas of mathematics, that the attempt to award their endeavors with prizes, rewards or trophies like the Fields Medal were met with rejection not because these mathematicians lack intelligence but for profound considerations over the ethics, morality, or standards of the field. It is certainly a sign of the times that the greatest geniuses, whose work soars above the great mass of people, have felt the need to reject everything these prizes, rewards or trophies symbolize. These things symbolize for Perelman, as they did for Grothendieck before him, all the trappings of a class dedicated to putting the freedom of thought behind bars like a caged animal.

Centered on the discussion of Tomahawk missiles, the missiles never came off the ground in the U.S. The Ukrainians are still waiting for those Tomahawks months later.} The article is one of the least well designed disinformation campaigns in the history of the war. The charts the author provides are transparently false. The diagram that it provides of Dobropillia does not display a circle; it does not demonstrate by way of shapes what is encircled. It has a series of fortified lines. These lines are not connected in a circle or encirclement. It show arrows from Ukrainian counterattacks. While an encirclement may ensue from a series of counterattacks, an encirclement arises after the exploitation of weak point leads to a line hardened by defenses. There are no lines hardened by defenses after or between the counterattack arrows. The fire brigade, Azov, already reconstituted more than four times with more than four changes in its commander, was already dispatched to Pokrovsk's defense but alas changed little to nothing for the Ukrainians dying to protect Metinvest Holding, LLC's assets for "\textspanish{El 'Abramovich' de los miners}." It was a last stage for securing the city from collapse but the stage fell through the floor. The characteristic lack of Ukrainian command was highlighted in the article when the Azov commander admits how only after being locked into a room for more than two weeks with a joint HQ, Corps command was restored. In the middle of a pitched battle lasting months, the fire brigade arrives to restore the chain of command. It reads like a foregone conclusion.

These cannot be the highest bar humanity can reach. The process of discovery begs for a breakthrough. \newline \indent The obsession with quantum physics is an obsession with a story about neutrons, electrons and photons; Niels Bohr's discover that an atom's electrons and photons circle about the neutrons like the heavenly bodies is a forgotten perspective in the fanfare around the obsession. A sundial is many times more accurate than an atomic clock because without the sun there is no time. Time itself is so intrinsic to the sun that sunless time is simply not time. \newline \indent Fuzziness sounds like apparitions. Anyone with even a rudimentary education in the history of cosmology and physicks reads entanglement like Ptolemy's apparitions. Ptolemy's system, alive for a far longer period of time than quantum physics with a far greater history of observation than quantum physics, enjoyed a far greater history of predictive power than quantum mechanics. Ptolemy's \emph{Algamest} predicted celestial events like eclipses and planetary positions, empowering the ancients with the ability to see the clouds before they formed. Predictability is thus no more of a reason to believe quantum mechanics than Ptolemy's \emph{Algamest}. \newline \indent Einstein, a great theoretical physicist, appears when we observe him but disappears when we do not; Einstein's intuition, which is not ordinary human intuition, is far more informative than the opposing points of view on quantum mechanics. Einstein's suspicion about EPR\footnote{The paper Einstein, Podolsky, and Rosen published in 1935 celebrated its 90th anniversary during the third anniversary of the Ukraine war. Despite numerous attempts to corroborate quantum mechanics by way of statistics, the EPR paper remains without resolution.} bears a strikingly resemblance to Ptolemy's epicycles. The incomplete part of the theory of quantum mechanics is replaced with the imposition of our assumptions about the perfection of the paths heavenly bodies map out in equal times with equal areas. Just as two circles, neither real, affected the path of the heavenly bodies in Ptolemy's \emph{Algamest} by virtue of our own ambition to imagine things as they should be to us than they are in fact, so objects separated in space and time are connected with a line of communication in excess of the speed of light in quantum mechanics. Einstein's proof, discounted only by statistical data for a correlation (without causation) corresponding to entanglement, is thus still solid reasoning.

While I haven't had a chance to read the manuscript, I suspect that the treatise is more philosophy like Plato's Republic than merely finance. It is likely that information central to the dialogue is the question about how to order a society with money or the orderliness of money for society.

\entry{relativity} {} {} {It is often the case that far more is forgotten than remembered. It is more often the case that of the things remembered far more is forgotten. So it is for Nicolaus Copernicus, the greatest luminary of the 15th century, . In his book \emph{On the Revolutions of the Heavenly Spheres}, first printed in 1543 in Nuremberg under the Holy Roman Empire, Copernicus destroyed three millennia of thought through his provision of a model superseding Ptolemy's geocentric system. \newline \indent Copernicus is the first to mention far more than merely the centrality of the sun to the earth's orbit. Copernicus is the first founder of the theory of relativity.\footnote{Under the Arab empire Muhammad established from the 7th century onward, the Semitic conception of time evolved. The Semitic tradition, our tradition, is far more concerned with "time than space." (Heschel, 1951: Prologue, \emph{The Sabbath}) Embedded in the earliest discussions of mankind from Babylon are discussions of time; in the Old Testament, the creation of the universe is "paradoxically" measured in terms of the number of "days" (presumably measured by the sun and night), the creator takes to craft the earth and the skies but the earth remains fixed. \newline \indent The Quran preserves the Semitic narrative (54:7) but neither sun nor the moon are anchored to a fixed earth, suggesting through interpretation the realitivity of the sun through coiling. Night and day coil (i.e., 31:29 and 39:5) while the day comes from different points of the Orient but the night from different points of the Occident (70:40; 55:17; and 43:38). Coiling, the root of which verb in Arabic is \textarabic{كور}, recalls the type of rotation in situ a person describes about his head for a turban. The argument is that the relativity of the sun derives more closely from an interpretation of these Quranic verses than from the supersedure of Ptolemy's geocentric system. Reading verses like 13:2, 31:29, 35:13, and 39:5, however,  against the Old Testament certainly liberates, emancipates, or exalts the concept, for in those verses Muhammad exclaims the existence of a course for the sun. In fact, 36:38 attributes a destination to the sun's course (i.e., the solar apex at a point in alpha lyrae). While these interpretative approximations are in no way an equivocation to the system Copernicus envisioned, they completely dispel the myth of a universe with the earth at the center without a sun in an orbit. \newline \indent Dependent upon a notion of time associated with cosmology, a few scholars reject these considerations in favor of the idea that Muhammad's revelations expound the complete absence of time altogether. The idea, they claim, lead inevitably to its most modern expression in Julian Barbour’s idea of the unreality of time from \emph{End of Time} (1999). In his book the unreality of time comes not from Mach but an article the Cambridge idealist J. M. E. McTaggart (1866 - 1925) published. In an article called “The Unreality of Time” that McTaggert published in \emph{Mind} (1908), McTaggart negated the existence of time on the basis of our assumptions about consciousness. McTaggert, who is not a philosopher, posits the existence of a requirement that a conceptualization of a thing must not be contradicted but without argument he claims the application of his standard negates the self-contradictory reality of time itself. In the absence of an understanding of a contradiction, any discussion of time, however, is utterly hopeless. The basis for Aristotle's own conception of the principle of non-contradiction, for instance, relies on the assumption that a thing cannot be but one way at a time, lest the idea of speech itself become moot. Hence McTaggert's discussion of time belongs not to physics but to philosophy. \newline \indent The verses these scholars cite to reject Muhammad's considerations of time are precisely the ones that support Einstein's theory of relativity. Verses 32:5 and 70:4, for instance, suggest in the former how a day may be traversed in a thousand years, while in the latter the same may be in 50,000 years. These verses are far more suggestive for Einstein's concept of time in the theory of relativity than the verses on the relativity of the sun are for the heliocentric comos Copernicus envisioned. Verse 51:47 lends further weight to Einstein's theory. The verse ascribes to the cosmos a state of expansion with the root for the Arabic verb being \textarabic{وسع}, the root commonly used to describe the width of a plane. It is a widely supported claim in the general theory of relativity that the observed differences in the increased distances of one galaxy from another in the red spectrum of their spectrum corroborates Einstein's physics. What is even more fascinating is that Muhammad's verse (32:5; 22:47) equating a day's travel to a thousand years is calculated by way of the moon to equal the speed of light. If time is calculated by an equivalent to the speed of light in an expanding universe, as Muhmmad claims, these Quranic verses in particular and the Quran in general are more suggestive of Einstein than Copernicus.} In his establishment of a heliocentric system opposed to the geo-centric, Copernicus's revolution not only accounted for the earth's three motions about the sun but unleashed a way of thinking so profound as to seed the growth of relativity. Relativity turns Copernicus' thought on its head, opposing the systems in relation to the observer, just as Copernicus himself opposed the Ptolemaic system from his own point of view. While many remember Copernicus, many have forgotten his words. Of the words they remember, far more has been forgotten.}

\entry{Set Theory} {} {} {The mindset behind set theory is one of the challenges the 21st century pursuit of discovery adopted from the 20th and 19th century. The decision to dissolve the presentation of proof into a logic based on sets broke from a tradition developed in antiquity. Descartes, for instance, interpreted algebra geometically as late as the Enlightenment. Cantor's development of set theory in the 19th century, however, led immediately to problems with its exploitation for mathematics. While many of Cantor's ideas were easily represented geometrically such as the infinity of prime numbers, the world of mathematics became transfixed with the idea of sets. In the years following his death, mathematics witnessed a profound crisis. In an overt display of the subconscious, mathematicians attempted to derive the logic of set theory from mathematics in a major departure from the apodeitic reliance on geometry. It revealed the lack of confidence mathematicians behold in the depths of consciousness for the idea of a set. The resulting outpour of thought immediately erupted with uncertainty. On top of Bertrand Russel's paradoxes\footnote{Russel's paradoxes about the membership of a set of all sets, for instance, is one of these paradoxes; if the set of all sets is not a member of that set but a set, then the set of all sets is not the set of all sets, for the set of all sets would therefore be a member. The inescapability of set theory is less about mathematics than set theory itself; the theory itself is a crisis but mathematics does not depend upon the theory anymore than the infinity of prime numbers depends upon the cardinality of a set. The problem is method.}, Gödel's incompleteness theorem demonstrated the futility of certainty in a non-apodeitic system. Overall the appearance of set theory disrupted the steady flow of discovery from the application of the geometric method to a point where the practice suddenly became taboo.\footnote{Feynman's decision to present his long lost lecture, "The Motions of the Planets Around the Sun," with a geometric proof for planetary motion rather than with set theory signaled the beginning of a renaissance for apodeitic geometry that has hardly begun to set into the consciousness of the broad masses of thinkers in the sciences.} The set theoretic mindset has carried into multiple disciplines a preoccupation with logic that has restricted logical thought to no more than a single type of logic without recourse to an understanding of its place in the sciences.\footnote{In the words of Blaise Pascal's \textfrench{Pensées}, "The difference between the mathematical mind \emph{esprit de géométrie} and the perceptive mind \emph{esprit de finesse}: the reason that mathematicians are not perceptive is that they do not see what is before them, and that, accustomed to the exact and plain principles of mathematics, and not reasoning till they have well inspected and arranged their principles, they are lost in matters of perception where the principles do not allow for such arrangement. . . . These principles are so fine and so numerous that a very delicate and very clear sense is needed to perceive them, and to judge rightly and justly when they are perceived, without for the most part being able to demonstrate them in order as in mathematics; because the principles are not known to us in the same way, and because it would be an endless matter to undertake it. We must see the matter at once, at one glance, and not by a process of reasoning, at least to a certain degree. . . . Mathematicians wish to treat matters of perception mathematically, and make themselves ridiculous . . . the mind . . .does it tacitly, naturally, and without technical rules."

With 250 AI powered doctor less kiosks, the Shanghai metro, resulting in 95 percent accurate for diagnosis, 70 percent reduction in waiting times, a 30 percent reduction in waiting times. The AI powered doctor less kiosks measure basic human vitals after identifying a patient; these are blood pressure, health rate, temperature. The kiosk requests patients to describe their symptoms. The kiosks analyze the data received from the patients before transfer to a live doctor, if necessary. The diagnosis takes no more than four minutes. The process results in a 30 percent reduction in the costs of healthcare. Patients, whom the kiosks are able to diagnose on the spot, often receive medicine directly from an adjacent vending pharmacy. More than 15,000 users access the kiosks in the Shanghai metro every month, relieving pressure on the hospitals throughout Shanghai.  \newline \indent While the kiosks appeared in the Shanghai metro in October, the impact on doctors has yet to be fully evaluated. Doctors, who are highly trained specialists, are expected to devote more time to serious cases or research into cures for major illnesses sooner with greater insight.

Aimed more at stimulating the economy than changing the status quo ante, these reforms (i.e., interest rates for credit cards capped at 10 per cent, an exemption from property tax at the age of 65, a child savings account for children born in 2026, etcetera...) represented a last-ditch effort at populism in the face a shift of world historical significance for America's standing on the global financial arena. Scheduled to reach 40 trillion dollars before the 250th anniversary of the United States on July 4th, 2026, the Federal debt has become so large that credit markets have already begun to search frantically for an escape latch. Gold, for instance, rose more than 75 per cent from October, 2025 to January 2026, rising from 4,000 to 4, 600 dollars, the highest level for gold in its history. Blackstone, for instance, transferred more than two trillion dollars of its wealth abroad; while the disclosure alone is without details, one can only wonder how the wealth might well have been converted.\footnote{The United States of America restricts the amount of money an American may pocket on his or her way out of the country to no more than 10,000 but imposes no limit on the amount of money a company is allowed to transfer abroad.} Against the backdrop of a diminished dollar, the U.S. posted a trade deficit in the amount of 1.2 trillion dollars. Equivalent to China's trade surplus, the disparity marked a decisive turn of events in the historic competition between the two countries, despite Trump's attempt to coererce Xi Jinping reduce its trade surplus with the U.S. through tariffs. Almost none of the reforms resulted in immediate relief for working American families, the elderly, disabled, sick, or unemployed; the reforms became more of a gesture of goodwill than a resolution to any one of the problems these reforms sought to address. }

An AI query for union betrayals into Socialism AI may well produce an exhaustive list of the history of union betrayals the SEP derided.

These AI generated enumerations shall serve as a speaking indictment of the SEP's leadership on a factual basis for its complicity in terminating these struggles. Had the SEP's leadership not been complicit with the FBI's union collaborators in orchestrating these struggles, at least one or more of the struggles would have led to a completely different outcome. The fact that the SEP has repeatedly sought to blame unions for sell-out contracts in labor struggles, especially during the Biden administration, exhausted the diminished returns that narrative might have had on the further suspension of disbelief.

January 20th, 2026]} The conspiracy caused panic, forcing a significant rise in the yield for Japanese bonds; the yield on the 40-year bond reached 4.2 per cent, the highests since its debut in 2007, while that of the 10-year rose to 2.3 per cent, marking its highest level in nearly three decades. The effect became twofold; the mantle for investing free money from interest free Japanese loans pegged to Japan's currency fell; Warren Buffet profited so immensely that the Forbes trumpheted his success with a celebratory artice under the title, "Japan's Chaos is Warren Buffet's Jackpot."\footnote{The article later appeared as follows: ["Why Warren Buffett Is An Unexpected Winner From Japan’s Market Turbulence," \emph{Forbes}. January 21st, 2026]} The article describes how Warren Buffet's decision to invest in five trading houses epitomized "Buffett’s smart buying: the yen denominated debt he borrowed to acquire his stakes costs less than 1% per year, while the trading houses were paying dividends of about 4% per year. Called sogo shosha in Japanese, the sogo shosha (or “general trading companies”) were Mitsubishi, Mitsui, Itochu, Marubeni and Sumitomo. Accordingly, history will remember Buffet, the famous "whale of London," as financial samurai of the sogo shosha. 
\newline \indent Buffet's \emph{sogo shosha} trade is significant, however, for the statement's Citadel's CEO made at Davos, Switerland during the 2026 World Economic Forum. In a shot across the bow at Donald J Trump's so-called "populist" reforms (the majority of which are merely Stolypin reforms), Ken Griffin threatened Trump at Davos, Switzerland, declaring: "I actually think there's an explicit warning that if your fiscal house is not in order, the bond vigilantes can come out and retract their price," Griffin said.\footnote{Griffin dared not say the word but one cannot help but think he had in mind the idea of an audit.  No one dare beg for a \emph{Compte rendu} (the full name of which is a \emph{Compte rendu au Roi} (i.e., "Report to the King") like the document Jacques Necker published in February, 1781, the Finance Minister to King Louis XVI. In the report Necker, a constitutional monarchist, a political economist, a moralist, an author of a pamphlet attacking the principle of equality, explained in a characteristicly cryptic manner how ordinary revenues in France were exceeding royal expenditures by over 10 million livres (i.e., a massive surplus), while he conspiculously concealed "extraordinary" accounts. Necker's \emph{Compte rendu} thus accomplished a dual purpose. Its publication made the country's budget public – "a novelty in an absolute monarchy where the state of finances had always been kept a secret."[] But it also allowed for the public to subject the king's finances to a meticulous audit, especially regarding its omissions from France's participation in the American War of Independence against Great Britain. While the latter would only come after creditors unscruplously awarded the heavily indebted king a new lot in the amount of 520 million livres, the fact ultimately became a causitive factor in what followed. By 1788, continuously compounding interest on the king's renewed national debt racked France with a fiscal crisis. Necker's dismissal on 11 July 1789 corresponded with a Newtonian reaction among Parisians who set about to begin the famous Storming of the Bastille. Griffin's decision to replace the word "audit" with a fiscal house in order is thus calculated, premeditated, Orwellian Doublespeak, since Griffin knows neither an "audit" nor its public publication is either possible or even desirable for the United States.} Griffin's statement epitomizes the problem the United States faces with the Federal Reserve. The Federal government, which is obsessed with centralized power, is at the mercy of the banks, who pull the strings in Washington. America's monetary policy, far from the reform FDR's default believed he could achieve, has put the United States in a position of weakness. Griffin talks down to Trump. Trump, whom Griffin belittled, has no choice now but to cover before the banks. Described as "independence," private central banking, allowing banks to sell America its currency on loan, is the central issue of the day.  Buffet's sogo shosha trade demonstrates not only the issue's importance but a country's monetary policy empowers a banker to manipulate its entire economy for the personal benefit of a single individual. Griffin's threat to Trump is not only a declaration of war against Trump's populist strategy but an implementation of the financial pecking order. The problem for Griffin or Griffinists, who believe in the eternal power of capital, is that the chickens have already started to roost, regardless of Trump's populism. Griffin's declaration of war is thus nothing more than a reflection of his nostalgia for bygone days.

The police State bureaucracy's belief that the best way to live for an America is to accumulate wealth without any appreciation for how wealth is accumulated in America is not only naive but contrary to the pursuit of life, liberty or property, since no individual, let alone a representative from government, may impose upon an American citizen his or her vision of that pursuit. The pursuit, however, is completely meaningless, if individual natural rights or liberties aren't preserved.} \newline \indent The most important contributor to the scientific revolution, Sir Isaac Newton, heaped praise on Solomon. In 1675, Sir Isaac Newton annotated a foreword to an anonymous copy of  "Manna - a disquisition of the nature of alchemy", a treatise from fellow scholar Ezekiel Foxcroft, where he expressed his reasons for examining Solomon's Temple by writing: "This philosophy, both speculative and active, is not only to be found in the volume of nature, but also in the sacred scriptures, as in Genesis, Job, Psalms, Isaiah and others.

The \emph{New York Times}, well before the Jack Texeira leaks, published article after article, detailing the 'Spring' counteroffensive's military objective, telegraphing to the Russians not only the upcoming offensive but its aim. In an article published in the \emph{New York Times} on March 8th, 2023, for instance, where the authors claim “Bakhmut is [the] Mercenary Group’s ‘Last Stand” in Ukraine, the authors say the “campaign will likely focus on the southern region of Zaporizhzhia, where Ukraine is building up forces, [as] Col. Roman Kostenko, a member of Ukraine’s Parliament who is serving in the country’s military, told Ukrainian television on Monday.” In another article published on March 13th, 2023 by the \emph{New York Times} under the title, “Kyiv Seeking to Evacuate a Town It Controls,” the logic, the authors write, is to capture “territory around Melitopol,” so that “Ukrainian forces [may] sever a Russian line of control from the Crimean Peninsula to the Donbas region.” On March 14th, 2023, \emph{the New York Times} in an article entitled, “Russian Attacks Yield Little but Casualties in Wide Arc of Ukraine’s East,” repeats: “the Ukrainians, anticipating a big influx of Western weaponry and fresh troops in the coming weeks and months, are widely expected to mount a counteroffensive." The article continues: "Analysts, Ukrainian officials, and even Russian commenters have suggested that it would come on the southwestern part of the front, with the Ukrainians [attempting] a push east from Kherson and south from Zaporizhzhia toward the city of Melitopol, hoping to sever the land bridge the Russians have seized that links the Crimean Peninsula to the eastern Donbas region.” Ukraine’s singular goal, we are told in an another article published on March 21st, 2023 with the title, “Little Time on the Battlefield to Dwell on Notions of Peace Talks,” is to bide time until Kyiv’s troops retake the initiative in the war. The “moment,” the authors explain, “remains unknown outside the close circle of the Ukrainian military high command.” It would seem that within the span of less than two weeks in March, 2023 the \emph{New York Times} exposed the Ukraine's  battle plans in their entirety well outside the close circle of Ukrainian military high command. Given the amount of time from March to June, four months, the \emph{New York Times} likely accomplished more for the exposition of Ukraine's battle plans than Russian intelligence itself. \newline \indent Finally launched in June, the 'Spring' counteroffensive started in summer.

Appointed to the overall command of the Donbas theater immediately after Ukraine's great 2022 Kharkiv counteroffensive launched on September 6th, 2022, Surovikin began construction of the complex network of defenses immediately. In its concluding remarks on an analysis of the Surovikin lines, the Center for Strategic and International Studies stated: "Russia has constructed some of the most extensive systems of military defensive works seen anywhere in the world for many decades."\footnote{["Ukraine’s Offensive Operations: Shifting the Offense-Defense Balance," \emph{CSIS}, June 2nd, 2023.]} Composed of layers of defenses such as minefields, dragon's teeth\footnote{[\textarabic{أسنان التنين تكتيك روسي "قديم" لصد الهجوم الأوكراني المضاد،العربية،  : ٢٩ يوليو ٢٠٢٣}]}, anti-tank ditches, trenches, pill boxes, and other barriers designed specifically to entrap the incoming Ukrainian 'Spring' counteroffensive, the construction of the Surovikin lines relayed heavily a Russian advantage in equipment.

It is capable of digging 800 meters of man-sized trench in one hour in 3rd gear. The minimum radius is 25 meters.

A series of ten  redoubts, defensive earthworks, designed to trap the Swedes in marshes during the battle of Pultova in 1709 is the first. The great redoubt at Borodino constructed under the auspices of one of Russia's most colorful generals, Mikhail Kutuzov, whose famous ability to defeat enemies, especially the Turks, in retreat cemented his preeminence in annals of Western warfare, upset Napoleon Bonaparte's bid to compel the Russians to capitulate in 1812.

Surovikin's construction of a major defensive network of earthworks thus places his generalship firmly and thoroughly within the line of the great Russian generals of the 18th, 19th, and 20th century.

It is estimated that most of all or nearly all fiat currencies in countries whose monetary policy relied on private central banks (i.e., independence for the bankers but enslavement for everyone else) have lost more than 90 per cent of their purchasing power over the lifespan of their circulation. The U.S. dollar, for instance, has lost nearly 98 per cent of its original purchasing power, becoming closer to a penny than the dollar for which its lowest denominated note denotes.\newline \indent America does not have at its disposal a comparable store of value for the amount of money China has consistently generated over the past three years.

The gap from America's trade deficit to China's trade surplus is thus equivalent to 1, 200, 000 gold bars. It means that in terms of one of the rising stores of value available for comparison, the wealth of the Chinese nation generates double the gold equivalent of all of America's gold reserves every year for the past three years. If you compare the gold equivalent to the amount of money separating America's trade deficit in 2025 from China's trade surpluse in that year to the sum of America's gold reserves at the time the United States established the new monetary system at the Bretton Woods Conference, held in Bretton Woods, New Hampshire from July 1st to July 22nd, 1944, the difference could not be any less startling. When the conference convened, the United States maintained two thirds of the world's supply of gold reserves. The difference from today to the Bretton Woods Conference demonstrates in terms of gold alone how America's status as a global superpower has by so many degrees thus diminished.

It is less than one thirtieth by half a tenth. If the Federal debt cannot exchange a store of value in gold for more than 96.5 per cent of the Federal debt, the lack of exchange for the dollar threatens the dollar with collapse.

If so, the loss of more than 40 trillion dollars worth of wealth to accompany the same in debt or the equivalent of 20 to 40 million gold bars would certainly be the great financial crisis of the millenium, since no equivalent sum in the history of mankind has ever evaporated in a financial crash. } will cause.

The Switchblade-300, whose production facilities are overseas, costs many times more than an average FPV drone but without an immunity to Russia's electronic warfare. In an article published on October 23rd, 2025, Viktor Dolgopiatov, who heads Burevii, a design bureau pioneering [an] emergent class of [weapons],the "average ground drone (UGV) in Ukraine, for example, has a life expectancy of just one week."\footnote{["Western drones are underwhelming on the Ukrainian battlefield," \emph{The Economist}]} With a lifespan far shorter than expected for the Switchblade-300, the weapon suddenly became obsolete. \newline \indent The rapid evolution of drone warfare prompted the U.S. Army to take note of its obsoletion. In February 2022, the U.S. Army issued its first notice, requesting sources to supply Switchblade 300s, perhaps indicating a desire to strike a balance in a cost benefit ratio. In November 2022 the Army issued its second notice, submitting a Request for Information (RFI) on loitering munitions, directly referencing the conflict in Ukraine, which “has clearly demonstrated the ability of unmanned systems at increasingly lower echelons of employment,” especially for “[delivering] lethal effects.” \newline \indent In contrast with the Shahed, whose versions, modifications or models are studied in detail by both sides, the United States has not developed a loitering munition with a degree of intensity comparable to the Russo-Iranian project's emphasis on iteration.

\entry{Syntopicon} {} {} {Syntopicon, whose 70th anniversary coincided with the outbreak of war in the Ukraine, is one of the greatest syntheses of the greatest ideas in the Western World. Published initially in 1952, the second edition issued in 1990. The syntopicon is represents the second and third volumes of a 54 volume set of a collection of the Western World's greatest books.\footnote{The first volume is \emph{The Great Conversation}. The second is \emph{The Great Ideas I}; the third is \emph{The Great Ideas II}; the fourth is Homer; the fifth is Aeschylus, Sophocles, Euripedes, Aristophanes; the sixth is Herodotus and Thucydides; the seventh is Plato; the eigth is Aristotle I; the ninth is Aristotle II; the tenth is Hippocrates and Galen; the elevenths is Euclid, Archimedes, Apollonius, Nicomachus; the twelfth is Lucretius, Epictetus, and Marcus Aurelius; the thirteenth is Virgil; the fourteenth is Plutarch; the fifteenth is Tacitus; the sixteenth is Ptolemy, Copernicus and Kepler; the seventeenth is Plotinus; the eighteenth is Augustine; the nineteenth is Thomas Aquinas I; the twentieth is Thomas Aquinas II, the twenty first is Dante; the twenty second is Chaucer; the twenty third is Machiavelli and Hobbes; the twentyfourth is Rabelias; the twenty fifth is Montaigne; the twenty sixth is Shakespeare I; the twenty seventh is Shakespeare II; the twenty eighth is Gilbert, Galileo and Harvey; the twenty ninth is Cervantes; the thirtieth is Francis Bacon; the thirty first is Descartes and Spinoza; the thirty second is Milton; the thirty third is Pascal; the thirty fourth is Newton and Huygens; the thirty fifth is Locke, Berkeley and Hume; the thirty sixth is Swift and Sterne; the thirty seventh is Fielding; the thirty eighth is Montesquieu and Rousseau; the thirty ninth is Adam Smith; the fortieth is Gibbon I; the forty first is Gibbon II; the forty second is Kant; the forty third is American State Papers, the Federalist and J.S. Mill; the forty fourth is Boswell; the forty fifth is Lavoisier, Fourier, and Faraday; the forty sixth is Hegel; the forty seventh is Goethe; the forty eighth is Melville; the forty ninth is Darwin; the fiftieth is Marx and Engels; the fifty first is Tolstoy; the fifty second is Dostoevsky; the fifty third is William James; the fifty fourth is Freud.} The syntopicon is a synthesis of the topics found in those books, introduced with a standardized introduction a single author wrote for no fewer than 102 articles on the Great Ideas of Western Civilization.\footnote{The first Syntopicon I, Volume 2, contains entries on the following: Angel, Animal, Aristocracy, Art, Astronomy, Beauty, Being, Cause, Chance, Change, Citizen, Constitution, Courage, Custom and Convention, Definition, Democracy, Desire, Dialectic, Duty, Education, Element, Emotion, Eternity, Evolution, Experience, Family, Fate, Form, God, Good and Evil, Government, Habit, Happiness, History, Honor, Hypothesis, Idea, Immortality, Induction, Infinity, Judgment, Justice, Knowledge, Labor, Language, Law, Liberty, Life and Death, Logic, and Love The second Syntopicon, Volume 3, contains entries on the following: Man, Mathematics, Matter, Mechanics, Medicine, Memory and Imagination, Metaphysics, Mind, Monarchy, Nature, Necessity and Contingency, Oligarchy, One and Many, Opinion, Opposition, Philosophy, Physics, Pleasure and Pain, Poetry, Principle, Progress, Prophecy, Prudence, Punishment, Quality, Quantity, Reasoning, Relation, Religion, Revolution, Rhetoric, Same and Other, Science, Sense, Sign and Symbol, Sin, Slavery, Soul, Space, State, Temperance, Theology, Time, Truth, Tyranny, Universal and Particular, Virtue and Vice, War and Peace, Wealth, Will, Wisdom, and World} Aiming to be comprehensive of Western thought, ordered alphabetically, from Angel to World, the syntopicon misses much. The list, for instance, omits much of mathematics; the ideas of shapes, numbers, symmetry, sets do not appear in the list.\footnote{The lack of an entry in the syntopicon for geometry in the first edition from 1952 ultimately led to the removal of Apollonius' \emph{Conic Sections} from the second edition in 1990, even though one pillar on the ruins of Aristotle's cosmology arose from Kepler's exploitation of the ellipsis Apollonius' \emph{Conic Sections} demonstrate. The disregard for geometry thus had profound implications for the syntopicon's foundational assumption; if the Great Books of the Western World preclude Apollonius through a progression from the first to the second edition, the progression unveiled a regression. The Great Books turned away from Kepler's revolution towards Aristotelian cosmology.} There are entries for aristocracy, constitution, democracy, government, justic, law, oligarcy, opposition, punishment, war, peace, wealth, the lost of which may fall under idea of politics but no entry for politics. If ever there needed to be a starting point for a list of the greatest ideas of the Western World, the syntopicon succeeds fully. The arduous process of indexing the ideas as they occur throughout the volumes took place before the era of computers, consuming no less than 400,000 man hours; the work represented a major undertaking the likes of which computers have been trained nowadays to overcome within minutes, if not seconds. The syntopicon is thus a great feat in the history organizing ideas. The syntopicon's 70th anniversary therefore revives the great Western alphabetic index.}

\entry{Syria} {Syr·ia} {Noun} {
The collapse of Syria's Assad regime, a fifty year old dynasty, is a result of the Ukraine war. Unique among the results of horizontal escalation, the collapse of Syria's Assad regime is a coalescence of processes arising from the Arab Spring with those of the Ukraine war. \newline \indent Al-Sharaa, an extremely clever Arab, trained a special division of his troops in drone warfare shortly before he launched his lightening offensive from Aleppo to Damascus, indicating how an element of the Ukraine war (ultimately derived from the Azerbaijanians in the \emph{Nagorno-Karabakh} war over Armenia\footnote{} complimented others such as the withdrawal of Russia's Private Military Company, Wagner, from Syria.\footnote{[\texthebrew{רוסיה מסיגה את כוחותיה בסוריה וריכזה אותם בשלושה שדות תעופה כהכנה להעביר חלק מהם לאוקראינה. מעבירה בסיסים למשמרות המהפכה וחיזבאללה, תיק דבקה, מאי 6, 2022}]}, both a result of Russia's full-scale invasion. While coverage on Al-Sharaa's lightening offensive is scant, if not brief, other elements receive a great deal of attention in the newspapers. In the mainstream Israeli press, the newspaper, \emph{Maariv}, published a series of articles detailing how nearly twelve months before the collapse of Syria's Assad regime Iran began to reduce its presence in the country.%\footnote{\texthebrew{[חוששת מישראל? איראן מצמצת את נוכחות בכירי משמרות המהפכה בסוריה , מעריב, 01.02.2024]}, \texthebrew{[איראן חוששת מישראל וצמצמה נוכחות בסוריה, בכירים במשמרות המהפכה עזבו ,ידיעות האחרונות, 01.02.2024]}, \texthebrew{[בעקבות גל החיסולים: "איראן מצמצמת את הנוכחות שלה בסוריה" ,01.02.2024]}. This element, undoubtedly a result of Israel's decision to expand its war with \emph{Palestina} from the Gaza Strip to Lebanon, is less related to the Ukraine war than the other elements. It clearly illustrates, however, the Grand Chessboard. For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction in the zero sum cosmos. Alongside the fall of Bakhmut-Artemovsk, the collapse of the Assad regime represented one of the greatest moments in the geopolitics of the war.}

\entry{to temper} {} {} {In his famous book, \emph{The Prince}, Machiavelli asked on which side of a scale containing one of two animals the challenge for a ruler ruling over people weighs most heavily according to a given situation. On one side, Machiavelli sets the fox. On the other side, the lion. The weaker of the two is supposed to represent \emph{cunning} without strength. The stronger of the two \emph{brute force} with intelligence.  According to Machiavelli, a prudent ruler must be adaptive, changing to new situations, as problems arise, acting as a fox "in order to recognize traps" and as a lion when he has no choice but to "frighten off wolves." Machiavelli argues that the lion, the one symbolizing strength over intelligence, "is defenseless against traps" while the fox, the one symbolizing cunning over brute force, "is defenseless against wolves" and other physical threats; an effective ruler draws on the necessary, though not mutually exclusive, attributes of these great beasts, to keep his crown. \newline \indent It would not be fair to dismiss Machiavelli's analogy outright for imprecision but no analogy escapes reality unscathed; Machiavelli's is no exception. What is a trap? Who lays traps? Who benefits from traps? Is there not room for a hunter? \footnote{In his unparalleled contribution to the study of being in the \emph{Metaphysics}, Aristotle, for instance, criticized Socrates' theory of the forms by virtue of the third man; if man is man by virtue of his participation in the form of man, a second form for participation is required. A third form relating the form for participation to that of the participant is thus required. The process continues ad infinitum. Socrates' theory of the forms thus becomes a wind egg. (c.f., \emph{Theaetetus} 161a) Is there no third man argument by which great philosophers like the Jewish monotheist, Aristotle, might make to undermine analogies like Machiavelli's? Is it not plausible to imagine a hunter behind the scenes of the fox and the lion? } \newline \indent It is clear that Machiavelli's understanding of the scales of beastliness or animality is nothing but to be contained in the eye of the \emph{arbiter elegantiarum}. An example is an elegant debate. A trap laid for the public, the two jaws of the foot piece, designed to catch the minds of readers, came in the form of a measure designed according to its counter-measure, the two corresponding momentanae.  \newline \indent The article published on April 12, 2024 by the \emph{New York Times} under the title "The Math on Ukraine Doesn't Add Up"  (the measure) was written so as to be a measure for its pre-existing counter-measure. Senator Roger Wicker's memo entitled, "Production is Deterrence," with a publication date on April 22nd, 2024 is the pre-existing counter-measure. With the measure before its counter-measure appearing sequentially, the Republican Senators, J. D. Vance and Roger Wicker, successfully tempered a trap for swaying American public opinion about "the math" on a range of issues related to Ukraine's war \textfrench{matériel} away from disapproval to support for funding. The math, which adds up in Senator Roger Wicker's memo, doesn't in J. D. Vance's article but publishing the latter before the former allows for latter to appear as a refutation. The refutation, however, was designed according to what was to be refuted well ahead of time. Senator Roger Wicker thus tempered V. D. Vance to publish his article before his memo.  \newline \indent Since the American public is never informed about the backroom discussions centering on or the creation, revision, or conversations with newspapers about, these documents, the sequential nature of forming the measure according to a pre-existing counter-measure is entirely concealed from the public's eyes, just like a hunter's trap is concealed from a fox's or lion's feet. Out of sight, out of mind. Machiavelli's analogy is thus a great starting point for identifying the humanistic aspects of governance. Why would any one have any need for speechless beasts when so much is clear from speech alone? \newline \indent  Passage of the funding sailed through the two houses of congress onto President Biden's lap in no time.\footnote{["US House approves 61bn in military aid for Ukraine after months of stalling," \emph{The Guardian}, April 20th, 2024]; ["What the US Congress passed to aid Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan," \emph{Reuters}, April 23rd, 2024]; ["US Congress passes Ukraine aid after months of delay," \emph{Reuters}, April 23rd, 2024] } While the Republicans passed funding for Ukraine's war \textfrench{matériel}, funding made no apparent difference, as the Ukraine failed to change the status quo ante on the battlefield in any noticeable way. None of the Ukrainian newspapers, such as the \emph{Kyiv Independent} or \textukrainian{\emph{Українська правда}}, published articles, describing how the newly passed aid for Ukraine or its new war \textfrench{matériel} made much of a difference. \newline \indent The problem is neither the hunter nor the trap but the fact that for the most part the animals never really realize what being trapped truly means. The failure to realize one is trapped is related almost exclusively to the fact that trap's objective is less to trap than to reinforce entrapment. The design of opposites, the counter-measure for the measure, ensnares people into thinking that these opposed points of view are really an opposition. The fact of the matter is that beyond the symmetrically designed teeth on opposite ends of a trap is a far greater wonder to behold. It is logic.

\entry{trade surplus, China's} {} {} {During the second anniversary of the Ukraine war, China, the world's second largest economy, shocked the world in 2024 when it announced a surplus from trade exceeding 990 billion dollars, beating a previous record from 2022 (i.e., the first year of the Ukraine war). China, however, beat the 2024 record in 2025. China's trade surplus in 2025 exceeded 1.2 trillion dollars, despite Donald J Trump's tariffs.\footnote{China met Trump's threat to impose tariffs as high as 145 per cent on Chinese goods with its own levy on the export of rare earths; China's a dominant player in rare earths. Capable of monetizing the extraction of inaccessible elements, China's ability to process extracts for sale is unrivaled. The crisis led to a one-year truce after a summit in South Korea in October, 2025.} Tariffs imposed by President Trump on China accomplished little, causing Chinese exports to the United States to drop by nearly a fifth.\footnote{["China’s Trade Surplus Reaches a Record of Nearly $1 Trillion," \emph{New York Times} January 12th, 2025], ["China’s Trade Surplus Climbs Past $1 Trillion for First Time," \emph{New York Times}. December 7th, 2025], ["How China racked up a 1tn trade surplus," \emph{Financial Times}. December 11th, 2025], ["China blames US for trade imbalances as surplus hits record 1.2tn," \emph{Financial Times}. January 14th, 2026], ["China Announces Record Trade Surplus as Its Exports Flood World Markets," \emph{New York Times}. January 14th, 2026]} \newline \indent China's 2025 trade surplus stands in direct contrast to the U.S.'s trade deficit. In a first of its kind correlation, the U.S. trade deficit is more or less equivalent to China's trade surplus with neither country affecting the balance much at all. The correlation is a historic correlation in the history of economics. Never before in the history of mankind, let alone economics, have two rival economies, the first but with a trade deficit, the second but with a trade surplus, met at a single figure as high as the figure for 2025. Compounding the problem is that China's trade surplus in factory goods alone is much larger as a share of its economy than that of the United States immediately after World War II when most of the likely competitors were in ruins; it is also so during the early years of Worl War I when the United States peacefully churned out civilian goods while more than six European nations battled to transform the subversion of or more competitors into a stepping stone for its own global dominance. China's trade surplus in manufactured goods now exceeds a 10th of the country's entire economic output. The result has been the creation of millions of jobs in China with factory closures or layoffs in other countries like Germany. China's production of electric vehicles has shattered the German automotive industry. In the face of Chinese competition, Volkswagen, one of Germany's most iconic automotive brands, second only only to Toyota Motor in the number of cars it sells globally, closed a plant in Dresden after 24 years. Volkswagen’s woes mirrored those of the German economy, which shrank in 2023 and 2024 and has been stagnant in 2025.\footnote{The situation with China thus highlights how the uneven results "a revolt of the forces of production" elicit for the world economy. In his book, \emph{Bolsheviki and World Peace}, Trotsky wrote how "World production revolts not only against the confusion produced by national and state divisions but also against the capitalist economic organization, which has now turned into barbarous disorganization and chaos." (1918) The increase in jobs in China led to the loss of jobs elsewhere. China's plans for its economy upbraided those of other economies, creating disorder. While one economy produces the largest trade surplus in history, another slumps. One economy's tariffs may have a negative impact on another but no positive impact on the one. ["Volkswagen May Close German Plants for First Time in Its History," \emph{New York Times} October 30th, 2024], ["Volkswagen to End Production at German Plant, a First in Company History," \emph{New York Times}. December 16th, 2025], ["Volkswagen Suffers More Than Rivals From Auto Industry Woes," \emph{New York Times} January 10th, 2026]} Statistics such as these indicate that for intents and purposes, the United States cannot meet or beat China's economy. It is a sign of the times that the correlation indicates the upward trajectory of China's economy against the downward trajectory of the United State's. \newline \indent The United States appears to be oblivious. While the United States is pouring hundreds of billions of dollars into what are nothing more than police State activities, China is outperforming the U.S. economically. Activities such as the purchase of contracts with Palantir, the dispatch of Immigrations, Customs and Enforcement officers to Minnesota,\footnote{The United States leverages the full cooperation of every member of the Federal government to orchestrate media spectacles. In terms of the media spectacle in Minnesota, the Federal government has intentionally exploited loopholes in the structure of Article III to induce psuedo-legal points of temporary authority for suspending individual or citizen rights illegally. Called "Kavanaugh stops," ICE agents are subjecting Americans to unlawful stops without reasonable suspicion in Minnesota. The stops are illegal. In one immigration lawyer's analysis of Justice Brett Kavanaugh’s footnotes in two separate opinions on socalled "Kavanaugh stops," one an earlier, another a later opinion, Kavanaugh at first allows the practice of stopping people without reasonable suspicion only to prohibit the practice later. In an opinion under the caption, \emph{DONALD J. TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, ET AL. v. ILLINOIS, ET AL.} from December 23rd, 2025, Kavanaugh denied an Application for a Stay where Kavanaugh clarifies his earlier position in footnote number 4 (Docket No. 25a443; Date Filed: 10/17/2025; 7th Circuit; Order on December 23rd, 2025 from the OT in 2025.). The first footnote came from an opinion under the caption, \emph{KRISTI NOEM, SECRETARY, DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY, ET AL. v. PEDRO VASQUEZ PERDOMO, ET AL.} from California; denied on September 8th, 2025. While changing one's position from one footnote to the next may not be illegal, conspiring with members of the Federal government to do so is clearly illegal. The American rule elite's disdain for American citizens could not be clearer than in the machinations between these two fully orchestrated opinions.  \newline \indent It is clear the Federal government is playing with the structure of Article III to provide psuedo legal points of temporary authority for personal ingratiation. Kavanaugh's actions together with the allegedly dissenting opinons, which are dissenting merely for the sake of the appearance of a conflicted court that is wholly unified, is clearly destructive of Americans' natural rights. Since these actions are clearly destructive of Americans' natural rights, they, ipso facto, proscribe the application of Thomas Jefferson's remedy for destructive forms of government. On July 4th, 1776, he wrote: "That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new Government, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness." It is clear that Americans have no choice but to apply Thomas Jefferson's remedy. ["ICE Apprehension of US Citizens Derided as Kavanaugh Stops," \emph{Bloomberg Law}. October 21st, 2025]} paying Federal agents from the Socialist Equality Party to write screeds or publish propaganda on the World Socialist Website or the Central Intelligence Agency paying high school students "to hack" innocent American citizens' computers for the agency's own personal gratification demonstrate America's commitment to oppression at a time of economic woes. Just as China is beating the United States economically every day, day in, day out, America's decision to burn cash on the political persecution of its citizens rather than invest in the entreprenuerial spirt of American innovation, discovery, or invention is rebounding. It is clearly a major turning point in its history. Whereas in the years following the post-World War II economy America prospered, the United States began to degenerate after 1973. In the intervening fifty years, the United States quelled protests the Federal government did not intentionally inspire such as those inspired by the Vietnam war or the desire for equality. In contrast to those decades, the United States now quells protests the Federal government has intentionally inspired; the protests in Minnesota, for instance, are not a response to illegal laws like segration but the illegal enforcement of immigrations laws against Americans in a crisis the United States itself created with its open border polices together with its broken immigration system. America's behavior could not be less clear. The degeneration of the modern American State is now akin to a chagrin loser, unleashing his or her rage at the people closest to them for no reason other than their proximity in space, time, or relation. American citizens are now subject to the whimsical outrage of a State resembling a thoroughly dispossessed person seemingly incapable of basing his or her actions on sound strategy, policy, or law. America's turn away from achievement, performance, or excellence but towards irrational oppression is thus a profound expression of the personal discontent within the State of its untenable affairs. \newline \indent If not for the intentionally inspired protests than the proliferation of the State itself, the United States has reached a profound crisis.  The U.S. has hundreds of agencies, tens of thousands of commissions, offices, departments, bureaus, or corporations but none have accomplished anything for the country, except a trillion dollar trade deficit. You would think that at least one or more of those units of Federal governance would have a positive impact. The numbers, however, speak for themselves. The proliferation of the modern American State has bred nothing but parasitic excess. Agencies like the CIA or ICE are excess. Countries like China do not have these agencies. As a result, China is flourishing at levels hithertofore unknown to man; its trade surplus alone stands as a testament to its greatness. While former countries like the Union of Soviet Socialists Republics, often bemoaned as the greatest perpetrator of oppression, paled in comparison to the United States, the USSR had no more than a single agency called the KGB. The exact number of U.S. agencies is unknown, just like the amount of money spent on their irrationality.

In Kirov, Sky News reported that the Russians utilized tunnels to establish control over a major Ukrainian stronghold.\footnote{["\textarabic{باستخدام نفق.. قوة روسية تسيطر على معقل أوكراني كبير.}"]}  In the months following Russia's victory at Avdiivka, the Russian military television show, \textrussian{Военная Приемка}, premiered an episode entitled, \textrussian{Связь в СВО} in July, 2024, explaining how Russian \textrussian{связисты} (i.e., soldiers specialized in communication) accompanied Russian special forces in the Avdiivka tunnels. Trained in fabricating, welding, torching, the Russian special forces combined various skills to traverse the distance from one end of the tunnel to the other. The Russians later utilized this tactic against in the Kursk direction where Russian special forces traversed one of the empty gas pipelines to dislodge the remaining Ukrainians from the region. In September, 2025, reports began to emerge from the Ukrainian military analyst, describing how Russians infiltrated deep beyond the lines of the Kupiansk fortress. Sky News Arabic subsequently picked up the story, publishing an article on September 13th, 2025.\footnote{["\textarabic{فيديو.. القوات الروسية تتسلل عبر نفق إلى كوبيانسك}"] Subsequent reports in Russia's \textrussian{Регнум} media on September 21st, 2025 appeared under the following title, "\textrussian{По трубе - в тыл противника : ВСУ готовятся к сдаче Купянска}."}\newline \indent Though a WWI tactic, Russian tunneling thus far has not followed the WWI pattern of digging large networks like the Railway Wood or the tunnels in the Messine Ridge Offensive for mining but has utilized existing pipelines for gas or other utilities to provide underground passage to the rear.

% A Russian blogging channel called, \textrussian{Крупнокалиберный Переполох}, published several episodes, examining tunnels used by Ukrainians in areas the Russians captured in 2023. The host guides viewers through the tunnels. The cart he uses for his journey is fairly common, indicating how frequently both belligerents have relied upon standard equipment to travel from one end of a tunnel to another. In one of the episodes entitled, \textrussian{В поисках оружия}, the host shows viewers weapons recovered from Ukrainian tunnels. Filmed in conjunction with the \textrussian{Донецкое Управление ФСБ}, the episode features a Spanish knife called an \emph{extrema ratio}. The hosts eats a can of \textrussian{фасолевый суп}, a canned ration from one of the Ukrainian tunnels.

\entry{unipolar moment} {} {} {China's unipolar moment occured slowly, without fanfare, a media sensation, or a major political event. China's rise to the World's Superpower happened gradually over time primarily due to its ability to exploit the weaknesses its own enemy exposed frequently, carelessly, or haphazardly. During the third stage in the destruction of America's superpower, beginning in 1973 but beginning in 1991, prepared the groundwork for most of the schemes China has exploited to develop societal, technological, cultural, or economic\footnote{} gains against the United States. During the period from 1991 to 2008 when the United States began to display the character of self-destruction more deeply than in the previous three stages stages, the United States became aware of China's rising might in all of its manifestation but simply ignored the warning signs. In the fifth period of America's lost superpower, the United States could not but watch as China began to benefit immensely from strengthening the results derived from the techniques America's own mismanagement of its exposed weaknesses provided. The fifth period of America's lost superpower is from 2008 to 2026 when America's currency as the world's global reserve currency subsided.\footnote{["Could the US dollar lose its reserve-currency status?" \emph{Allianz} June 6th, 2018], ["What if – the US dollar loses its status as the world’s reserve currency?" \emph{Roland Berger}.

\entry{uranium} {} {} {During the Ukraine war, uranium\footnote{In a documentary produced under the auspices of the Bureau of Mines of the United States Department of the Interior called \emph{The Petrified River} (1957) on uranium mining in the West, the narrator provides a short, concise, straightforward explanation of uranium. It describes uranium thus: "For the elements that make our earth came from the fiery cores of ancient suns, billions of years ago. The simplest of all these elements is the hydrogen atom; it has a single proton in its nucleus and an electron that circles it like a planet. Within suns hydrogen atoms fuse together and are joined by two neutrons. The result is a completely new element, Helium, whose two protons attract a pair of circling electrons. Helium in turn becomes the next heaviest element, Lithium, as more particles join its nucleus. Thus one by one all the 92 elements were forged in stellar fire until the heaviest atom of all was, uranium, was created. Uranium, with a nucleus of 92 protons and nearly twice as many neutrons held together by stellar energy. Uranium, whose energy man has learned to liberate. When a neutron strikes a uranium nucleus, it is absorbed. Under the strain of the added particle, the nucleus grows unstable and splits in two with a burst of energy, releasing more neutrons. In a mass of uranium, the neutrons of one fission travel on to produce further fissions, liberating more and more energy in an intense chain reaction. This same energy will eventually light our cities, run our factories, and power our ships and planes but to harness it man must build atomic reactors."} assumed a significance rivaling that of oil. Alongside the rise in the price of uranium compared to the beginning of the Ukraine war, the competition among great powers to source uranium, to build atomic reactors or forbid non-aligned States or State actors from building atomic reactors, harnessing nuclear power, controlling liberated stellar energy or otherwise capitalizing on the physics of energy, intensified sharply. \newline \indent The Ukraine war acerbated the rising price of uranium like no prior event in the history of the element. In the years prior to the outbreak of the SARS-CoV-2, the price for uranium remained relatively low. The price of the uranium, used in nuclear power stations to generate electricity, rose by 14 per cent from the range of 24 to 26 to 27 dollars after the virus began to cause closures at the mines in Canada, Kazakhstan, and Nimibia. More than a month before Russia's full-scale invasion, the price of uranium jumped to 45.65 dollars. Kazakhstan, the world's largest producer of uranium, supplies more than 40 per cent of global demand through state-controlled Kazatomprom. Akin to the position of OPEC plus for Brent crude, Kazakhstan dominates uranium. In the days leading up to February 24th, 2022, China cornered more than fifty per cent of Kazakhstan’s market. China purchases more than half of Kazakhstan’s output. Since the major export route passes by rail through the Almaty region, the clashes there slowed exports, causing the price to rise.\footnote{In the last decade, China has accumulated vast reserves of uranium with a supply equivalent to 11-12 years of demand.} Without any mention of AI, data centers or sources of electricity, the Financial Times mentioned how uranium is essential for “the electrification of the global economy, with nuclear energy seen as reliable source of low carbon power.”\footnote{It is important to mention that In a famous remark about the “giant fusion reactor in the sky,” Elon Musk has criticized nuclear energy, claiming solar power to provide an equivalent amount of power, yet harnessed from the Sun. In a tweet on December 14th, 2025, he stated: "The Sun is an enormous, free fusion reactor in the sky." Calling them "pet science projects," Musk denigrated the push for building nuclear reactors. In an earlier interview, Musk explains in an interview the amount of electricity a solar park generates is roughly equivalent to that of a nuclear reactor. Musk’s point may sound like a minor technicality but against the backdrop of the rising price of uranium, the comment assumes a conspiratorial overtone. Is the emphasis on uranium merely a way to generate monies or profit for mines, investors, or finance capital? Is it a pet science project that the great powers are building or a lucrative hobby horse?} \newline \indent Launched on February 24th, 2022, the Ukraine war immediately cast doubt over the supply of uranium and its enrichment, causing prices for the precious metal to soar. Russia, the largest builder of nuclear power plants globally, is responsible for more than two-fifths of active worldwide enrichment capacity. With sanctions threatening Russia's economy, the specter of Russia's removal from the global nuclear fuel chain became a source of disruption and price volatility. The result price became 63.80 in 2022. The imposition of sanctions on Russia followed Congress’ renewal of a ban on the purchase of Russian enriched uranium imports to the U.S., the observance of which hardly applied, raised the price of uranium together with the war. The war and the reaction to the war thus augmented the price immensely. Shortly after the fall of Bakhmut-Artemovsk on May 23rd, 2023, Niger witnessed a coup. The coup hastened fears over the global supply of uranium.  A major supplier to the EU, Niger sells a quarter of its uranium to Europe. In September 2023, the price of uranium surged to its highest level in 12 years. In a global renaissance of nuclear power, the exploitation of uranium for the assertion of great power caused a further rise in the price of uranium. Continuing the momentum of 2023, the price of uranium rose to 91 per pound level. By February, prices reached 105.91 dollars, marking a nearly two decade high. In 2024, the Ukraine witnessed its third anniversary, where much the fighting whittled down from heavily mechanized spearheads thrusting across great distances such as in the beginning of the war or in Ukraine’s successful Kharkiv offensive to largely positional attritional warfare in a positive territorial stalemate for Russia. Against the backdrop of uncertainty in Africa with Niger’s request for American withdrawal from the country, the price of uranium continued glisten on the outward rays of the conflicts on Ukraine’s horizon. Towards the end of 2024, Russia imposed its on negative export controls on uranium, crippling supply for the largest importer of Russian enriched uranium. In 2025, prices largely stabilized around 82 dollars. \footnote{ ["Uranium bucks weak commodity trend," \emph{Financial Times}.],  ["Uranium prices jump as Kazakhstan upheaval stokes supply concerns," \emph{Financial Times}. January 6th, 2022.], ["Uranium rallies as energy crisis puts nuclear power in focus," \emph{Financial Times}. September 12th, 2022], ["Uranium: Niger coup highlights mellower view of yellow metal," \emph{Financial Times}. August 1st, 2023], ["Uranium prices hit 12-year high as governments warm to nuclear power," \emph{Financial Times}.

November 20th, 2024], ["Uranium shortfall threatens nuclear energy renaissance, industry warned," \emph{Financial Times}. September 5th, 2025] } \newline \indent While lithium, oil, or other elements certainly compare, no element on earth epitomizes the futility of decoupling a nation-state, let alone a great power like Russia, from the global economy through the unilateral imposition of sanctions, tariffs, or levies; the inescapability of Russia’s role in the enrichment of the global supply of uranium underscores the latent interconnectivity which the political form of nation and state, however, brazen, simply cannot overcome. The struggle for “the subjection of the world-embracing economic system to the profit interests of the bourgeoisie of each country” to become the world’s superpower leads inevitably to “barbarous disorganization and chaos,” “a ceaseless struggle for new and ever new fields of capitalist exploitation, which must be obtained from the one and same source, the earth.” The supply of uranium thus concentrated in only a few countries with the enrichment process equally concentrated in Russia, demonstrates how intractable the global economy to singular dominion truly is.}

Журнал Научно-исследовательской ассоциации при Коммунистическом Университете трудящихся Востока имени И. В. Сталина.}. \newline \indent The first journal, which is less political than the other two, focused on surfacing the "\textrussian{вечные образцы}" the ancient world beholds. The journal does not address nationalism, a central issue of political division separating Trotskyists from Stalinists, in articles where the subject recommends itself for discussion. An examination of the journal's treatment of China, for instance, reveals that neither Lenin nor Stalin, the two most frequently quoted authorities on nationalism, appear in articles about China, the Chinese republic, Chinese history, Confuscianism in China, Chinese poetry, or Chinese literature in any of the five books by a single author. \textrussian{"Китайская республика",  "Очерки современного Китая," "Учение Конфуция в китайском синтезе," "Ли Бо.

The imposition of the Stalinist world view required scholars to kowtow the party line into every nook and cranny of the otherwise free thought the October generation exprienced prior to the Soviet Union's degeneration under Stalin's bureaucratic centralism. \textrussian{Восток} is therefore a testament to the flourishing of human thought during the relatively prosperous first years of Soviet power under Lenin's democratic centralism. \newline \indent In the second journal, the authors address nationalism directly. Although comparative historical analysis makes no mention of the differences betwee these three journals, the silver lining is the editor. \textrussian{М. Павлович (Вельтман)}'s close association with Trotsky in the Petrograd Soviet both during the 1905 and 1917 revolutions and his participation in Trotsky's Military Revolutionary Committee during the Russian Civil War and his knowledge of politics distinguish his journal from the other two markedly. Comparing \textrussian{М. Павлович (Вельтман)}'s "\textrussian{Ленин и Народный Вопрос}" from \textrussian{Новый Восток} (i.e., \textrussian{№}. 5) with "Сталин и Колониальный Восток" from \textrussian{«РЕВОЛЮЦИОННЫЙ ВОСТОК»} (i.e., \textrussian{№}. 8), the revisionism of the latter is a reflection of the putrid degradation to which Stalin's implementation of bureaucratic centralism plunged the entire Soviet Union. It devastated study into the East.  \newline \indent An obscure but astute Menshevik who became a Bolshevik with an exile spanning many years of stable residency in France before the great Russian revolution, named \textrussian{М. Павлович (Вельтман)}, led the editorial board of the journal until his untimely but timely death in 1927 on June 19th. During the fifth anniversary of the Ukraine war \textrussian{М. Павлович (Вельтман)} marks the 100th anniversary of his death.\footnote{\textrussian{Вместе с М.П.Павловичем (Вельтманом) похоронены: Вельтман Мария Михайловна (1877–1940), жена С.Вельтмана; Вельтман Соломон Лазаревич (1883–1960), учёный секретарь Научной ассоциации востоковедения, брат М.Павловича; Вельтман Павел Михайлович (1885–1962)}} Born on March 13(25), 1871 in Odessa, Ukraine, \textrussian{М. Павлович (Вельтман)} began to participate in social-democratic circles as early as 1892. At the age of 21, the Russian czar's secret police arrested \textrussian{М. Павлович (Вельтман)} for revolutionary activity, exiling him to Siberia in the city of \textrussian{Верхоянск}, a town in Verkhoyansky District of the Sakha Republic, Russia, located on the Yana River in the Arctic Circle, 92 kilometers (57 mi) from Batagay, the administrative center of the district, and 675 kilometers (419 mi) north of Yakutsk, the capital of the Sakha republic. Just six years later, \textrussian{М. Павлович (Вельтман)} joined the Russian social-democratic workers' party (RSDRP); \textrussian{М. Павлович (Вельтман)} conducted party activity in Odessa, Ukraine, and in the Capital of Moldova, Chisinau. \textrussian{М. Павлович (Вельтман)} worked closely with Lenin in Paris, France from 1901. After the second conference of the RSDRP (1903), \textrussian{М. Павлович (Вельтман)} joined the Mensheviks. During the revolutionary years of 1905 to 1907, \textrussian{М. Павлович (Вельтман)} worked in the RSDRP's Petrograd military organization. After the full suppression of the 1905 January revolution, \textrussian{М. Павлович (Вельтман)} returned to Paris, France where he stayed for ten years until the outbreak of mass protests in Petrograd. During those ten years, he converted himself into an expert in self-determination, nationalism, and liberation in the Middle East. During WWI \textrussian{М. Павлович (Вельтман)} voted against war credits for nations, advocating for internationalism. After the October revolution, \textrussian{М. Павлович (Вельтман)} worked for the People's Commissariat of Foreign Affairs. In 1918 he joined the Russian Kommunist Party (Bolsheviks), becoming the head of the Main Committee on the State Buildings of the Russian Socialist Federation of Socialist Republics (RSFSR). In 1919-20, \textrussian{М.

Chasiv Yar, one of the villages Evgeny Prigozhin sought to capture with the Wagner PMC, together with Toretsk, are like Vuhledar and Avdiivka in that they are also twin battles. Chasiv Yar and Toretsk represented in 2025 what Avdiivka and Vuhledar represented in 2024, major, long time bastions of fallen Ukrainian resistance in the Donbas. Whereas Avdiivka fell on January 17th, 2024 before Ukraine's Kursk offensive, Vuhledar fell during Ukraine's Kursk offensive when the Russians began to revive the Soviet military doctrine for encirclement from its famous operation during WWII called \textrussian{Операция Кольцо}, the largest-scale economy-of-force offensive ever conducted in the history of modern combined arms warfare. \newline \indent The success of the following \textrussian{Кольцо} operations in the Donbas after the fall of Vuhledar led to the subsequent fall of the minor villages stretching from Avdiivka to Pokrovsk in the remainder of 2025.

\entry{War Mapper} {} {} {It may be that elements of the security elite attacked an account under the handle: \emph{War\_Mapper}. WM provided monthly updates on Ukraine's lost territory month over month. What is unique about WM's updates is how well programmed they were. His website provides tracking on "Overall control of Ukraine," recent "Changes to Russian held territory over last 12 months," "Control of Ukrainian Oblasts," such as Donetsk, Luhansk, Zaporizhzhia, Kharkiv, or "Control of Russian Oblasts" such as Kursk and Belgorod. WM began publishing on February 24, 2022 but abruptly stopped on April 9th, 2025. On April 9th, 2025 WM posted on X. The update described how "Russian forces advancing west of Nevske and Terny have reached and taken Katerynivka as well as positions along the Ukrainian fortification line in the area." In Zaporizhzhia, "Russia has taken the settlement of Lobkove," WM wrote, "after the recent capture of Stepove and Mali Shcherbaky. A Ukrainian counterattack into Shcherbaky has prevented its capture so far. Southwest of Pokrovsk, Russia has attacked towards, and come within 3km of, the Dnipropetrovsk Oblast boundary. In Belgorod, Russian counterattacks have pushed Popovka and Demidovka back to contested settlements. Russia crossed the Oskil again, this time at Kamianka. They now control or contest seven settlements on the west side of the Oskil. The situation in Toretsk is more clarified since the last post on the city. Though widely contested, Russian forces retained a presence in areas throughout the city. These have since come back into their control, and some forces have now moved northwest of the city." These updates were the last on the Ukraine war. Detailing the entirety of WM's contributions would require use of third party software such as TamperMonkey or ViolentMoneky to download, save or process. \newline \indent WM's charts, built on the German company, DataWrapper, facilitated insights into Russia's positive stalemate on the frontlines following Russia's receipt of Ukraine's lost initiative in the aftermath of the bloody battle of Bakhmut-Artemovsk (\emph{See} Bakhmut-Artemovsk above). It is likely that elements of the security elite attacked WM for publishing truthful information about the course of the war, a major transgression for the pro-Ukrainian supporters of the U.S-led NATO alliance, since truthful information about the course of the war inevitably points towards a Ukrainian defeat. Whatever the case may be, WM's disappearance after April 9th, 2025 indicated a major loss for the reading public's ability to analyze insights from information about the war's results quickly. \newline \indent Having fallen after Avdiivka and Vuhledar and Chasiv Yar and Toretsk, Pokrovsk represented the culmination of Russia's \textrussian{Кольцо} operations. The capstone of these operations in the southeastern Donbas is Vladimir Putin's declaration that Ukraine's continued resistance shall result in the fall of more villages like Pokrovsk. Putin's admonition is reflective of Russia's reality on the battlefield. The negativity of the battles in the Donbas reflect the reality that the average rate of advance over time coupled with Russia's refusal to draw Kyiv's capital under fire control with artillery undermine Russia's ability to capture the right bank of the Dnipro, the area of Ukraine Putin highlighted as Russian during an interview with Tucker Carlson on February 9th, 2023. It is clear that Russia can capture villages but a large scale offensive to capture the right bank of the Dnipro-at the time of his statement-cannot be justified any circumstance related to Russia's current standing in the war. The fact that the single greatest threat Putin can make against Ukraine is the capture of one of its villages in southeastern Donbas therefore represents therefore a major turning point in the war.

\entry{Water} {} {} {Water, one of the four elements the pre-Socratics held to be hule (i.e., thing). \newline \indent During the Ukraine war, the struggle for global superiority led to a dispute over water. A significant moment in the struggle arose when China started building on the Yarlung Zangbo River in Tibet a mega-dam designed to become the world's largest source of hydroelectic power. The Yarlung Tsangpo is the highest river in the world, surpassing some 5,000 metres (16,404 feet) above sea level. China began construction of the mega-dam just 30km (18 miles) from China's vast border with India where tens of thousands of soldiers from both sides are posted. India disputes the border. In response to China's construction of the mega-dam India’s Ministry of External Affairs "urged [China} to ensure that the interests of the downstream states of the Brahmaputra are not harmed by activities in upstream areas.” Water therefore became a significant flashpoint in the geopolitical struggle for access to, control over, or exploitation of sources of life such as water\footnote{Water reminds us to take nothing for granted, especially exploration. In his exploration of \emph{The Mysteries of Nature and Art} (1634), Newton explored John Bates' ideas thoroughly during his studies in elementary school, demonstrating how a pre-Socratic element may be more than merely an object of exploitation in a geopolitical struggle for dominance.}, raw materials, rare earths, or precious elements.

Whereas many like Eric Schmidt attribute consciousness to machines, Wooldbridge does not. Wooldbridge, for instance, does not believe that the latest version of ChatGPT reasons. He believes that the responses ChatGPT produces are not a reflection of reason but pattern recognition. The ChatGPT machine is able to mimic the responses of the large body of data. \newline \indent The problem with Artificial Intelligence is not necessarily the data but the first principles upon which builders rely to create machines like ChatGPT. The widespread reliance on a binary number system is responsible for the limitations of its logic. The binary number system lends itself to a logic where the primary mode of evaluation is nothing but a single choice: either the unit or its negation. Logic like propositional logic is precisely the type of logic that relies on the same. In a situation where there is no middle term, the limited logic of the machine cannot progress syllogistically. In the absence of a syllogistic type of logic, the ability to move from a minor to a major premise does not happen. Hence the machine's first principles are responsible for its inability to reason. Succinctly put, ChatGPT cannot reason for lack of a middle term. \newline \indent A machine whose logic avoids Leibniz' binary number system logic\footnote{In an interview at AI's Next Frontier, Geoffrey Hinton advanced the hypothesis that mathematics is a closed system like chess; he further claim that since AI play chess, AI can play mathematics. He further claimed that "I think that AI will get much better at mathematics than people, maybe in the next 10 years or so." Hinton's assertion is highly reductive. There is nothing closed about mathematics. You can try to reduce mathematics to a closed system but Godel's incompleteness theorem obliterate the idea of "closedness." Hinton's statement is tantamount to Hilbert's program. Godel completely disabled the project to find a complete and consistent set of axioms for all mathematics. Godel's theorems prove its impossibility. Gödel's incompleteness theory proceeds on the basis of two theorems. The first says that in any sufficiently complex mathematical system, there are true statements that cannot be proven within that system.  Lobachevsky's substitution of Euclid's fifth postulate for his own is an example. Like in Euclid's own system, no consistent set of axioms can be both complete and capable of proving all truths about geometry. The second theorem asserts that such a system cannot prove its own consistency. Euclid’s system cannot guarantee the deductive logic of truths subsequent to the axiomatization of the fifth postulate. The insistence on a set theoretic approach to thinking about mathematics is simultaneously a blessing and curse; a blessing for its brevity, expressiveness, and convenience; a curse for its confinement of the mind to the species of modus ponens and their genera. This is set theory, propositional logic, and the Principia Mathematica overthrowing intuitive, progressive, unified consciousness. The major way forward in AI is to find a way to dispense with Leibniz's binary system of 1s and 0s to a new way of counting; a logic with rules other than those in propositional logic with rules such as modus ponens, modus tollens, hypothetical syllogisms, disjunctive syllogisms, constructive dilemmas, conjunctions, absorption, simplification, or addition must give way to a new way of computing.} can be based on James Clark Maxwell's understanding of colors. In Maxwell's systems, there are three primary colors, Red, Green, and Blue. In much the same way that the Chinese have utilized DNA to record information on cassette tapes\footnote{In an article under the title, "A compact cassette tape for DNA-based data storage," published on September 10th, 2025 in \emph{Science Advances}, a team of Chinese scientists, who are far more productive than Americans, produced the first ever DNA-based data storage on a number system unrelated to Leibniz' binary number system. Americans could never achieved such a thing because America's police state bureaucracy, of which the Socialist Equality Party is an essential component, seeks to undermine its own citizens by transforming political dissidents into targets the Federal government exploits for the sake of laundering hundreds of millions of dollars on "investigations." America's insistence on wastefulness is extremely advanced, since the Federal government's police state organizations such as the Socialist Equality Party have infiltrated American universities with the a fellow police state organization, the United Auto Workers union. The UAW fulfills the function of an Orwellian thought police on graduate students so that laboratories in Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence, or Information Technology never benefit from the talented appreciation free thinking graduate students are entitled to enjoy in a true democracy. The money that America must spend on agents from the UAW to police graduate students is wasted on non-productive surveillance.}, the three colors, whose unity is white, produce four terms. A fifth term may be the deprivation of the four. A Maxwellian type of color-based storage could easily meet or exceed the storage power of DNA, since marking for DNA consumes more space on a ribbon in a cassette than color. Color on film would easily store far more than DNA on a cassette's ribbon, just as GAF viewers such as the "Pana-Vue 1" or "ViewMaster" demonstrate. Hence even in the area of data storage, which the repudiation of Leibniz' binary number system has already confirmed the extensibility of a non-binary system, Maxwell's color system may provide for greater computational power (being able not only to compute but to store information) than preceding types of computational systems.

\entry{Yemen} {} {} {During the third anniversary of the Ukraine war, Al-Jazeera published a post with a video no longer than 17 minutes on X. In the video the Qatari news channel described the first proxy war in the Middle East.\footnote{\textarabic{"أول حرب بالوكالة في الشرق الأوسط".. #المتحري يكشف جذور اهتمام إسرائيل باليمن وسعيها ألا يكون البحر الأحمر بحيرة عربية، وكيف تحوّل باب المندب إلى واجهة بدلًا من شبه جزيرة سيناء} [AJArabic:2009598633453482113]}  The video picks up right in the middle of Great Britain's occupation of Yemen when on the December 10th, 1963 the so-called Aden Emergency erupted. The video's first document is from April 22nd, 1964 when Great Britain decided to make contact with Israel in regard to Yemen. Penned to the SAS Squadron in Aden, the document outlines Great Britain's Secretary of State's approval for the creation of the Aden Group, a joint military intelligence group designed to coordinate Great Britain's activities with Israel for a mutually beneficial outcome for both parties. Great Britain's members joined the Aden Group from the Suez Group after Abdul Nasser nationalized the Suez Canal. Considered to be the last remaining vestage of Great Britain's Empire from the outcome of World War II, Yemen represented a number of problems for the SAS, whom the local Yemenis considered to be an occupying force. In what follows, the narrator explains how Yemen became the site of the Middle East's first proxy war with minor great powers, Israel and Egypt, funding one or more of the conflicted sides in Yemen to assert control over the country as a sphere of influence for a major power. The Egyptian army was fighting with the Yemeni republicans against the monarchists, whom the Aden Group sought to support. The Union of Soviet Socialist Republics supported Egypt; Great Britain supported one or more of the factions in Yemen.
\newline \indent The result of the Aden Group's first meeting resulted in Israel's first mission outside of its geography; Izthak Rabbin dispatched Zeev Liron, a fluent Arabic speaker, to fly undetected from Israel to Yemen for two things: 1) to confirm that a rebel tribal force in support of the Yemeni monarchy under Imam Hadr al Badr could actually fight against the Egyptians; and 2) secondly, Liron needed to confirm that the Badr intervention could be effectively executed without Egyptian interference. Based on a post unreleased operation report, Rabbin authorized the attack in support of Badr. 
\newline \indent On March 31st, 1964 a squadron of Israeli fighter jets left Israel from Israel's Tel Noof airbase south towards Yemen's Sanaa; the Israeli fighter jets were instructed to land in Djibouti, Ethiopia\footnote{The video displays a newsreel with Moshe Dayan with his famous eye patch, saying that Israel had a cooperation with Ethiopia for years and years. One of the witnesses explains how the Mossad maintained large bases in Ethiopia and Nairobi. } only to return north according to the same route. The mission focused on dropping weapons, the serial numbers of which specialists removed prior to the mission, for the sake of arming the Badr rebels with unrecognizable weapons that could not be traced back to Israel; most the weapons came from stockpiles of Nazi World War II weapons such as the heavy 81 mm mortars, such as the MG-42 machine gun, German luger 9 mm pistols, or British Enfield rifles.\newline \indent The Israelis sought to exploit the Yemeni conflict to weaken further the Egyptians, who became ever more bogged down in a fight against the Yemeni monarchists. With Egypt weakened, Israel gambled to reduce the risk of a renewed armed conflict with Egypt after the 1956 war. Weakening Egypt, however, was not the only goal. Upon the promise of a restored imamate, Badr royalist vowed to recognize the state of Israel.\newline \indent After the Egyptians lost the Sinai peninsula in 1967, the Egyptians turned south. The Egyptians were no longer able to block the Straights of Tiran due to the loss so the Egyptians sought to focus on Bab-al Mandeb where the conflict shifted. The video details how the wider implications of Israel's proxy war with Egypt in that area touched upon a more global struggle the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics raised with the West under the leadership of the United States. \newline \indent the video documents the involvement of the Palestinian Liberation Organization on an oil tanker transferring oil from Iran to Israel called the Coral Sea. \newline \indent The video ends with the Yom Kippur War on October 6th, 1973 where Egypt successfully recaptured the Suez Canal in a surprise attack, disabling Israel's ability to execute its strategy for weakening Arab control over the most important parts of the Arabian Peninsula, namely, the Suez Canal, the Straight of Tiran, Bab-al Mandeb, or the Red Sea in general.

\entry{Ypi, Dr. Lea} {} {} {Dr. Lea Ypi is one of the few female in the 21st to survive a highly predatory academia to publish a defended Ph.D. thesis upon receipt of her degree. While the modern world has accomplished a great deal on the order of female biology, the decision to treat women just like men in academia disregards these accomplishments, for a woman's biology is fundamentally different from a man's. A girl at the age of five, for instance, is considered an equal to a boy at five, when in all reality the former's biological clock runs nearly double or triple the time that a boy's clock runs; the cummulative effect is that academia, a slow, arduous, retaliatory apparatus the State weaponizes to extract life from brilliant human beings, exacts double or triple the toll on women than on men. A man may finish his academic career with a prospect for a family; a woman may finish her academic career with a prospect for menopause; the contrast cannot be underestimated, especially in the toxic climate of the West's modern academia. Despite setbacks, Ypi managed to graduate, although not without multiple additional degrees. Ypi is thus a role model for women, while academia may reflect less on her work than on reform; for faster admissions with faster graduations would significantly ameliorate the plight of the female academic. An intelligent woman should not be made to sacrifice her femininity for the sake of academia's slow, arduous, retaliatory apparatus. It should bloom with her work on a Spring schedule.\footnote{If not mentally traumatized, raped, or murdered, women have an exceptionally hard life in academia. On a faster biological clock, males in academia easily exploit female anxiety over the timeliness of their graduation to inflict pain with psychology. A delay in academia, for instance, is often double, if not triple, the impact for a woman than a man. The effect on woman can be life-alterating, to say the least.} \newline \indent In her Ph.D thesis, Ypi focuses on the so-called cosmopolitian state from the perspective of European analytics political philosophy. While describing the state\footnote{Since Hegel's \emph{Philosophy of Right}, no one can say anything about the State unless he or she says something about the \emph{Philosophy of Right}.} without any reference to any of its features\footnote{The idea of a State is a profound. In the 20th century, the Bolsheviks not only came to power on the basis of their understanding of the Russian state such as is described in Trotsky's \emph{Results and Perspectives} (1906) but dissolved into warring camps over its centralization (i.e., bureaucratic or democratic), its economy (i.e., for a New Economic Policy or forced collectivization), or its underlying role for the spread of revolution (such as in a series of countries, the most salient example of which is Germany) but in these explorations of the State a fundamental feature of the State is its contradictions, primarily in terms of Trotsky's theory of the political form of nation and state and its inherent contradiction with the ever increasingly globalized world economy. In terms of its existence alone, Trotsky wrote how "[the] nation must continue as a cultural, ideologic, and psychological fact, but its economic foundation has been pulled from under its feet" by way of war. The "objective significance of the War [World War I] is the breakdown of the present national economic centres" with the "subtitution of a world economy in its stead." The political form of nation and state proposed to solve the problem of imperialism "imperialism" was not through the "intelligent, organized cooperation of all of humanity's producers" but the exploitation of the world's economic system by the capitalist class of the victorious country," where the political form of nation and state is "transformed from a Great Power into the World Power."}, Ypi relates the state to cosmopolitianism. It is hard to understand how the cosmopolitianism of one State cannot be so strong that the cosmopolitianism of another marks a point of differentiation so prominent that the states become undoubtedly differentiated. The idea that the State may treated like a unit confounds the modern understanding of the State, for no State is created equal, equal, or equalizing. \newline \indent In terms of Ypi's later works, Ypi exhibits a common reflex in academia. The reflex is to daydream about the past. Academia bypasses the three hundred years after Kant to consider only Kant's \emph{Zum ewigen Frieden. Ein philosophischer Entwurf} from 1795 so that the scholar may close his or her eyes to the reality of contradictions Hegel's philosophy introduced forever hereafter into every aspect of modern life. The reliance on Kant's dream for a perpetual peace based on Kant's philosophy with devices like the categorical imperative make for excellent headlines but little to no substance for a resolution of the problem, for just as the categorical imperative dissolves, the dissolution of Kant's ideas of the State dissolve. The inescapability of the dissolution is as profound as the consequences of its dissolution, not just for philosophy but for the past three hundred years. These are years of the most profound warfare in mankind, the likes of which only an implementation of Hegel's philosophy unlock from the complex of contradiction.

Published in 1998, the BOOK, as the famous mathematician, Paul Erdős, envisioned the title, contain summarizations of proofs from books.  Grouped into five parts, number theory, geometry, analysis, combinatorics and graph theory. The book has passed through six editions from 1998 to 2014. 1st edition: Proofs from THE BOOK.

ISBN 978-3-662-57264-1.] Ziegler's book is certainly a major contribution to the discussion of mathematics. \newline \indent The chapter on number theory is by far the most fascinating. It is the most fascinating for a number of reasons. The first reason is that the book presents Euclid's theorem on the infinity of prime numbers from the perspect of set theory. Euclid did not envision prime numbers in terms of sets, since sets did not exist at the time Euclid composed the \emph{Elements}. The way Euclid's thought advances is thus fundamentally different from the way set theory operates on numbers. Euclid proved the infinity of prime numbers not by way of counting, zero, one, two, or three; he did not prove his theorem on the infinity of prime numbers by reference to any number at all; Euclid proved his theorem about inifinte primes by way of reference to points, lines, and planes on givens in specific proportions. It is important to emphasize this primary difference for two reasons; the reasoning of the ancient Greeks did not proceed in terms of quantities; the idea of magnitude, the likes of which requires a stability incomptibile with ancient Greece, did not figure prominently, if at all, into the abstract objects of the ancient Greeks. The ancient Greeks thought in terms of analogy\footnote{It is alleged that Aristotle devised fourteen different ways to invoke the so-called "necessity" of a demonstration. If any discussion in the history of the science of logic ever touches upon the idea of "necessity" Aristotle invokes to certify the irreversible requirement for admission of a logical inference. The idea that an inference may result in one and only one inference is the fundamental rule of Aristotlean logic. Is the necessity by which Aristotle's fourteen laws on the syllogism equivalent to the necessity by which Euclid's demonstrations require the admission of a logical inference without alteration? Can Euclid's necessity be reduced to Aristotle's? Is there a difference in the necessity? What is necessity? Are Aristotle's or Euclid's necessity without parallel to anything else in the sciences?}; the idea of magnitude is only cognizable in terms of pairs of entities, whose relationship may be replicated or manipulated to such an extent that the property in focus shifts from one pair of compared objects such as line to that of another; in Euclid's proof of prime numbers, he makes no mention of counting at all; he mentions only a comparison of pairs of compared objects in an analogy. Elements, Book VII, Pr.31, for instance, relies less on \emph{reductio ad absurdum} than on the pairs of compared objects in an analogy. Euclid's reliance on pairs of compared objects begins with the first proposition in the seventh book; the words "lesser" or "greater" both presuppose sets of compared objects. The latter end of the proposition relies upon a new set of compared objects in an analogy: "if the number which is left never measures the one before it until a unit is left, then the original numbers are relatively prime." The idea of a prime number, for instance, is thus relational; it is not only relational in terms of points or lines in a plane; they are relational in terms of the conceptuality of the differentiated idea of a number. The fact that neither Ziegler nor Aigner make no mention of Euclid's methodology demonstrates that these mathematicians have not taken note of the profound role method has played in the Enlightenment, if not the trajectory of mathematics; still more, the authors have not conveyed the original thought processes of Euclid's own method. This is a fundamental error for a book dedicated to the elegance of proof. It is actually far worse. The idea of a symbolic approach to Euclid's proof thoroughly undermines the ancient Greece insistence on speech; the ancient Greeks believed the idea of the written word merely reflected the ideas human beings exchanged verbally; it is not merely a nuance but a reflection of Euclid's explanation of things said; it is not a reflection of Euclid's explanation of things symbolized; Euclid did not envision mathematical entity in terms of symbols. The symoblization of mathematical entities is as inimical to the provision of demonstration as diagrams. Euclid explained ideas in ordinary, everyday, ancient Greek.  \newline \indent The second problem is with infinity itself. The third reason is that the first chapter hardly discusses the idea of the infinity. While familiarization with Euclid's demonstration on the infinity of prime numbers might compel readers to imagine infinity from the opposite of the necessity in Euclid's demonstration. The development of a progressive infinity based on the impossibility of a \emph{reductio ad absurdum} undermines the moments in the cognition of an expanding idea of infinity. \newline \indent It seems odd that Paul Erdős, who would have undoubtedly marvelled at the Dedekind \emph{Schnitt}, would not have mentioned Dedekind's famous proof, differentiating the real numbers by way of a division from the rational numbers. Dedekin's \emph{Schnitt} proceeds more like a construction than a demonstration. Dedekind's comparison of two sets thus gave rise to his understanding of a lesser compared to a greater infinity. In his definition of an infinite set, for instance, Dedekind described a set as infinite when it is "similar to a proper part of itself." The self-reflective construction of infinity thus separates contemporary number theory from ancient number theory by virtue of method but not merely in terms of the theoretical framework but within the progression from one mathematical entity to the next such that the former may be set up against the latter in a relationship. \newline \indent The absence of any discussion of Dedekind's methodology, which is easily duplicatable for extension into mathematics, is a startling omission. The fact that neither Ziegler nor Aigner make no mention of a comparison of Euclid's methodology to that of Dedekind's in terms of infinity is peculiar, since the focus of the first chapter is on infinity. It is also peculiar, since Dedekin's reliance upon points and a line in a plane recalls Euclid's theoretical framework. What is even more peculiar is that the relations between these sets, which are often described as lesser or greater, are not subjected to the transformation of a pair of compared objects in an analogy, as Dedekind's predecessor envisioned prime numbers and infinity.\footnote{If the set of rational numbers is countable but the set of real numbers is uncountable, the relation between the two ought to be 1) such that the comparison is duplicatable or else 2) the proportion itself is capable of reproduction by a pair of compared objects. The fact that one is less or the other great has not become the subject of a comparison draws into sharp relief the centrality of method for mathematics. It is not hard for a cobbler or a mechanic to see that less important for a solution is the problem itself than the way the problem itself is viewed. A cobbler may receive shoes. The most immediate response is to turn the shoe over to the sole. A mechanic receives cars. The most important view for him or her is from the bottom up. The ability to view a problem is at times more fundamental than the actual problem itself.} It is thus precisely here one would think not only an exposition of these different methods would be appropriate but necessitate a detailed exposition of their nuanced intricacies for the explanation of mathematics in general.

\entry{Zhukov, Gregory} {} {} {One of the great commanders\footnote{\emph{The Great Commanders} (2003), an award winning expert portrait of six men, places Zhukov after Alexander the Great, Julius Caesar, Horatio Nelson, Napoleon Bonaparte, and Ulysses S Grant.}, Zhukov executed a \emph{Blitzkrieg} on Germany towards the end of the war, traveling no less than 300 miles in a fortnight. While many in the circles of military war planners behind U.S.-led NATO's campaign for expansion of the private central banking alliance have only considered openly the revivification of Adolf Hitler's Directive 21, the inversion of Zhukov's late war campaign from east to west is one of the considerations for Moscow.}
